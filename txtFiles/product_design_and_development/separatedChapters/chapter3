 2009 3334 Chapter The pet products company FroliCat had introduced two successful laser based cat toys including the Bolt Exhibit product that embodies randomly moving laser beam to entertain cats The company management team hoping to build upon their initial success sought additional opportunities to develop new cat toys They were particularly interested in opportunities to extend their brand to other types of motion based cat toys FroliCat was small company and so an investment in developing new product represented substantial financial risk As result the team hoped to identify opportunities that would be highly likely to result in profitable products FroliCat was based in Chicago but because all of FroliCat products were produced by factories in China and because it wished to adopt more global market perspective it engaged Shanghai based product development consulting firm Asentio Design to lead the opportunity identification effort This chapter provides conceptual foundation for opportunity identification and articulates six step process which includes generating large number of alternatives and filtering them to identify those that are exceptionally promising We illustrate the opportunity identification process using the FroliCat example What Is an Opportunity In the context of product development an opportunity is an idea for new product An opportunity is product description in embryonic form newly sensed need newly discovered technology or rough match between need and possible solution At the earliest stage of development uncertainty clouds the future so an opportunity can be thought of as hypothesis about how value might be created For consumer products company like Procter Gamble an opportunity might be new type of cleaner suggested by customer For materials company like 3M it might be new polymer with unusual properties Some opportunities ultimately become new products while others never warrant substantial further development An opportunity for new product is usually articulated with less than one page of information often including descriptive title narrative explaining the idea and sometimes including sketch of possible product concept Exhibit shows the opportunity eventually pursued by FroliCat as it was first articulated following brainstorming session by members of the team The opportunity was for an interactive cat toy consisting of swinging object hanging from the underside of table which would be moved around by hand from above This is an example of an opportunity that includes possible solution concept which is typical for efforts focused on identifying opportunities for new products in well defined category like cat toys Types of Opportunities While there are many ways to categorize opportunities two dimensions are particularly useful They are the extent to which the team is familiar with the solution likely to be employed and the extent to which the team is familiar with the need that the solutionOpportunity Identification 35 Courtesy of Lucky Litter LLC and Future Life Labs EXHIBIT The swinging ball opportunity eventually pursued by the FroliCat team as first recorded in sketch This is an example of an opportunity that includes potential solution concept addresses For technology based products these dimensions can also be thought of as knowledge of the technology and knowledge of the market These two dimensions are illustrated in Exhibit Because risk of failure increases as opportunities deviate from what the team already knows well we can divide the opportunity landscape into categories based on the uncertainty horizon faced by the team Horizon opportunities are largely improvements extensions variants and cost reductions of existing products for existing markets They are relatively low risk opportunities Horizon opportunities push out into less known territory in one or both of the dimensions of the market or the technology Horizon opportunities represent attempts to exploit opportunities that in some way are new to the world embodying the highest level of uncertainty Because of the need to launch product within about year the FroliCat team explicitly avoided Horizon opportunities The team wished to build on its initial success with the Bolt cat toy and so focused on its existing customers and the existing needs it already addressed It sought next generation solution for the existing need to entertain cats and thus focused on Horizon opportunities 36 Chapter New Exploration into New category need market new markets products and service 36 00 Q0

process technology EXHIBIT Types of opportunities Horizons and represent increasing levels of risk reflecting different types of uncertainty Source Terwiesch and Ulrich 2009 Tournament Structure of Opportunity Identification Opportunities vary widely in value however that value is plagued by uncertainty It is therefore very useful to identify set of opportunities and then to select subset for further development with just few coming to fruition This process can be thought of as an innovation tournament with only the best ideas prevailing In most settings dozens hundreds or even thousands of opportunities are considered for every one commercial success filtering process selects subset for further development and from those picks one or more champions that will be launched as full product development efforts Exhibit illustrates this tournament structure The opportunity identification process embodied in an innovation tournament precedes the product development process as shown in Exhibit While both the opportunity identification process and the product development process consist of development steps and selection steps the overarching goals of the two activities are quite different In opportunity identification the goal is to generate large number of opportunities and efficiently kill those that are not worthy of further investment In the product developmentOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Opportunity Identification 37 79 Concept System Level Detail Testing Production Development Desngn Desngn Refinement Ramp Up Product Development Process Opportunity Identification Process EXHIBIT The tournament structure of the opportunity identification process The opportunity tournament feeds the product development process with exceptional opportunities Source Terwiesch and Ulrich 2009 process the goal is to take the opportunity articulated in the mission statement and do everything possible to assure it becomes the best product it can be Although opportunity identification and product development can be thought of as separate activities there is clearly some overlap between them For example in consumer product business like FroliCat preliminary product concepts are almost always generated and explored with prototypes during the opportunity identification process before formal product development process begins However these exploratory activities are typically conducted for several alternative opportunities with only the most promising proceeding to more comprehensive product design and development Exhibit illustrates the opportunity identification tournament structure used by FroliCat starting with 50 opportunities and eventually resulting in one chosen to go into full product development Effective Opportunity Tournaments Given that great opportunities are rare how can the opportunity identification process be managed to increase the number of excellent opportunities identified There are three basic ways Generate large number of opportunities If you produce more opportunities you ll see more exceptional ones The logic here is simple on average if you find one foot 213 cm tall person per 100 000 people you ll find two among 200 000 Creating more opportunities without sacrificing their average quality is thus key lever in finding the exceptional few 38 Chapter Opportunity Articulated as Mission Statement for Product DevelopmentTeam Opportunities with Exploratory Prototypes and Sample Packaging OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO 50 Raw Opportunities Opportunities with Representative Product Concepts Images courtesy of Lucky Litter LLC and Future Life Labs EXHIBIT The overall tournament structure of the opportunity identification process for FroliCat Fifty raw opportunities were eventually filtered and explored resulting in swinging ball opportunity that was developed into product launched to the market Opportunity Identification 39 Seek high quality of the opportunities generated Adopting better methods for generating opportunities and mining better sources of opportunities can increase the average quality of the opportunities under consideration which will also increase the quality of the best ideas resulting from the tournament Create high variance in the quality of opportunities This is direct though not immediately obvious implication of statistics Holding the average quality and number of opportunities constant you ll generate more exceptional ones from process that exhibits greater variability that is if it less consistent in the quality of its output The quest for variability contradicts normal approaches to process improvement but it exactly what you want in opportunity creation Generating wacky ideas and wild notions increases the chance that at least one of the opportunities will be exceptionally good Opportunity Identification Process We divide the opportunity identification process into six steps as follows Establish charter Generate and sense many opportunities Screen opportunities Develop promising opportunities Select exceptional opportunities 99 N1 Reflect on the results and the process Each step is the focus of section of this chapter Step Establish Charter Organizations create new products to achieve goals such as growing revenues from existing customers filling hole in product line or entering new market segments Entrepreneurs starting new organizations also have goals like creating new product related to an area of personal interest The innovation charter articulates these goals and establishes the boundary conditions for an innovation effort Charters are closely analogous to although somewhat broader than the mission statement for new product See Chapter Product Flaming For example the charter for the FroliCat effort was Create physical product in the cat toy category that we can launch to the market within about year through our existing retail sales channel The main restrictions in this charter were the emphasis on physical goods instead of software or services focus on the cat toy category preference for opportunities that would not require enormous investments of calendar time and desire to take advantage of the company existing relationships with retailers The charter requires resolving tension between leaving the innovation problem unconstrained and specifying direction that is likely to meet the goals of the team and organization By specifying narrow charter the team avoids wasting effort generating40 Chapter opportunities in areas that are unlikely to be pursued On the other hand sometimes deciding which opportunities are worthy of pursuit in advance and in the abstract is difficult Similar to the mission statement for new product we recommend that the innovation charter be broad perhaps bit broader than the team is comfortable with Generating ideas is inexpensive and sharpening the focus later is not difficult The benefit of allowing broad focus is that opportunities that may otherwise have never been considered will challenge the team assumptions about what kinds of opportunities it should pursue Step Generate and Sense Many Opportunities Based on survey of companies across many industries about half of innovation opportunities are generated internally to an organization and about half are recognized from customers and other external sources Terwiesch and Ulrich 2009 The distribution of sources of opportunities is shown in Exhibit We therefore recommend that the team explicitly focus on both internal and external sources of opportunities Typically the team will want to identify dozens if not hundreds of raw opportunities Fortunately this daunting task is made much easier through the application of some structured techniques which we outline here Techniques for Generating Opportunities For some creative people there is nothing more fun than coming up with new ideas However we find that the majority of people have hard time when asked simply to generate some promising opportunities For them the problem of coming up with something new is simply too abstract too unstructured and has too many degrees of freedom Following are seven basic techniques for stimulating the identification of opportunities Most work well in both entrepreneurial and corporate settings Internally generated Customer Competitive product Sales force University Independent inventor Distribution partner Other partner company Supplier 1O 20 30 40 50 60 EXHIBIT The distribution of sources of opportunities in innovation Source Terwiesch and Ulrich 2009 Opportunity Identification 41 EXHIBIT Nutrient delivery system worn during testing by the inventor Matt Kressy nutrient pouch tubing and valve on his right side Follow Personal Passion List your passions endeavors that keep you awake with excitement and then consider how emerging technologies trends and business models might influence them Or identify unmet needs that you have in connection with personal interest An avid bicyclist whom we know has been developing nutrient delivery system for use with existing hydration backpacks for example CamelBak which has applications for the military and for wide variety of sports Exhibit He identified the opportunity while reflecting on his desire to adjust the amount of sugar and electrolytes in the beverages in his hydration pack Compile Bug Lists Successful innovators are often chronically dissatisfied with the world around them They notice unmet needs of users including themselves List or photograph every annoyance or frustration you encounter over period of days or weeks and then pick the most universal and vexing ones and dream up solutions Any problem is an opportunity An annoyance that gives birth to the opportunity doesn have to be yours alone Instead you might find it through customer complaints or market research powerful way to understand others annoyances is to immerse yourself in the world of people using your products or services Pull Opportunities from Capabilities Theories of competitive advantage abound but most spring from the idea that firms achieve above average profits by exploiting unique resources Resources an umbrella42 Chapter term includes capabilities core competencies and competitive advantage To provide advantage resource must be Valuable To be valuable resource must either allow firm to achieve greater performance than competitors or reduce weakness relative to competitors Rare Given competition valuable resource must be rare Inimitable For value and rarity to persist resource must not be easily imitated Nonsubstitutable Even if valuable rare and inimitable resource providing advantage can be easily substituted This perspective abbreviated as VRIN can be used to define targets by first articulating an inventory of resources and then using the inventory as lens for opportunity generation Apple Computer VRIN resources for example might include excellence in industrial design leading brand and loyal customer base Each of these resources can guide the opportunity creation process by reformulating them as challenge For example In what other product categories might Apple design excellence create advantage For which product or service categories could the Apple brand be deployed to advantage What other products or services could Apple provide to its customer base Study Customers Opportunities can be identified by studying customers in selected market segment These studies also called user anthropology or consumer ethnography provide deeper understanding of the true customer needs than you can obtain through surveys Consider the bicycle industry Shimano maker of bike components like pedals and brakes recently commissioned user anthropology study to understand why more people in the United States don ride bikes The traditional approach to this problem would have been to create survey or set of focus groups asking customers how often they ride and what attributes of bike they value the most Most likely most Americans would say that they ride regularly which for some might mean once year and that they want light bikes with many gears Those after all are the product attributes emphasized in nearly every bike shop Unfortunately what people say to researchers and what they really do can differ substantially By spending many hours observing potential cyclists including time on and off bicycles Shimano researchers found that many consumers want bikes that are technically simple easy to ride and easy to get on and off all attributes that aren emphasized in the current competition among bicycle manufacturers who tend to emphasize the needs of biking enthusiasts User anthropology thus helped Shimano to identify set of latent needs See Chapter Identifying Customer Needs for description of latent needs When latent need is articulated it becomes target for the opportunity creation process Once they identified the factors that keep many potential customers in their automobiles as opposed to on their bikes they had the opportunity to redefine the product category In the case of Shimano these efforts led to the creation of bikes targeted specifically at the leisure rider that is people who might rent bike during their annual family trip to the beach but otherwise weren riding regularly Shimano developed line of components under the brand Coasting and manufacturers then incorporated them into their bikes One example is the Trek Lime shown in Exhibit Opportunity Identification 43 Courtesy of Trek EXHIBIT The Trek Lime bicycle incorporating the Shimano Coasting component group Consider Implications of Trends Changes in technology demography or social norms often create innovation opportunities Ubiquitous mobile telephone service for example enables wide variety of information delivery services An increasing Spanish speaking population in the United States for example enables new sorts of Spanish language media Growing environmental awareness creates market for green products and services Once again the means of exploration is easy list social environmental technological or economic trends and then imagine innovation opportunities made possible by each one Imitate but Better When another firm innovates successfully it in effect publishes the location of gold mine You can exploit this information by either considering alternative solutions that could address the same need or alternative needs that could be addressed with the same solution Exhibit shows examples of the imitate but better approach Here are some sources of opportunities for imitation Media and marketing activities of other firms Scan the media and monitor the activities of other firms by attending trade shows and following patent filings for example Articulate the need and solution associated with any innovation that you identify Generate alternative approaches to meeting the need or alternative needs that can be addressed with the new approach De commoditize commodity Often price competition characterizes product category and the offerings themselves are little more than commodities Recall coffee before Starbucks or breath mints before Altoids situation like this creates an opportunity for innovation To pursue this kind of innovation list all of the inexpensive undifferentiated products or services in category and then consider the possibility of deluxe versions 44 Chapter3 Stockbyte PunchStock SMC Photos The McGraw Hill Companies Inc ill Braaten photographer Ingram Publishing Alamy SMC Photos SMC Photos Existing Product Imitate but Better Product EXHIBIT Examples of the imitate but better approach SpinBrush Starbucks Altoids Opportunity Identification 45 Drive an innovation down market Four entrepreneurs with history in the toy and candy businesses invented the Crest SpinBrush in 1998 They believed that their competitive advantage was in creating small cheap battery powered devices as they had done with the Spin Pop lollipop spun by little motor They were struck by the array of electric toothbrushes many selling for about 100 yet none having much more complexity than their spinning lollipops They decided to create an electric toothbrush that can sell for six dollars Their SpinBrush became the best selling toothbrush of any type To follow their example list the premium products or services in category and then imagine much cheaper versions that provide many of the same benefits Import geographically isolated innovations Innovations are often geographically isolated particularly if introduced by smaller firms Translating the innovation from one geographic region to another can be source of innovation The Red Bull energy drink started as product for Thai truck drivers Starbucks founder Howard Schultz created the chain after visiting Milan and becoming infatuated with its cafe culture and espresso based drinks Mine Your Sources Recall that about half of product opportunities arise from sources inside an organization and about half come from outside sources As result you benefit from cultivating external sources of ideas Those sources include the following Lead users Firms have ample incentive to innovate Innovation after all can result in new sources of cash But lead users and independent inventors may have even greater incentives Lead users are people or firms that have advanced needs that may not be met by existing products or services Lead users must either tolerate their unmet needs or innovate themselves to address them Many devices and procedures in health care were invented by clinicians For example consider Dr Lillian Aronson veterinarian at the University of Pennsylvania who performs feline liver transplants Her procedure is relatively new the market is small and few existing surgical tools fit the task Dr Aronson thus has to choose between ill suited instruments and inventing her own If she invents useful device she creates an opportunity for further innovation by an established firm Representation in social networks Another way to increase the keenness of your sensing is to ensure that you are plugged into the appropriate social networks Social institutions of all kinds facilitate communication among innovators Some of these institutions may not be related to professional life Cricket and softball leagues in Silicon Valley are widely known to be hotbeds of entrepreneurial activity and have played key role in facilitating the exchange of ideas leading to opportunities for new products Online social networking communities and discussion forums also may foster communication among innovators Universities and government laboratories Students research staff and professors continually pursue novel solutions to vexing challenges In many cases the solutions identified in universities and government laboratories can be commercialized by third parties including existing companies and start ups Research universities and government laboratories have technology transfer organizations to facilitate this process Online idea submission Opportunities may be collected from customers and noncustomers through Web sites For example the computer company Dell runs Web site IdeaStorm for soliciting innovation opportunities from customers 46 Chapter Step Screen Opportunities The goal of screening is simply to eliminate opportunities that are highly unlikely to result in the creation of value and to focus attention on the opportunities worthy of further investigation The aim is not to pick the single best opportunity Given many opportunities to be screened the process must be relatively efficient even at the expense of perfect accuracy For this step very effective screening criterion is the holistic judgment by group of individuals of whether or not the opportunity is worthy of few days or weeks of additional investigation Separate application of multiple screening criteria market need technological feasibility alignment with strategy tends to bog down the process in unnecessary discussion Recall that in most settings you will have dozens or even hundreds of raw opportunities to consider Two methods are effective approaches to screening Web based surveys and workshops with multivoting Both methods rely on the independent judgments of group of people Typically this group comprises members of your organization but could be an extended entrepreneurial team or even friends and family members with relevant expertise Of course the group performing the evaluation must have relevant expertise even if that expertise varies in type and depth Web based interface can ensure that the participants don know the author of each idea so they will base their votes on the quality of the opportunity not their opinion of its originator Many free Web based survey tools are available or you can use one of the Webbased tools designed specifically for the purpose of evaluating innovation opportunities Web based screening survey can be as simple as listing of opportunities with short descriptions for which you ask respondents simply to indicate yes no vote on whether or not the opportunity deserves further investment Alternatively you can use 10 scale which may be useful if you have relatively small group of people voting In our experience you need at least six independent judgments and preferably more than 10 to make reliable decisions You can also use an in person workshop to evaluate opportunities In format we have used frequently each participant presents one or more opportunities to the group These presentations can be supported by single slide page or flip chart sheet We strongly recommend that these presentations be limited to about one minute and that each presenter adhere to the same time limit and format Summaries of each opportunity may be distributed in advance of the workshop Following the presentations you ask group of raters to multivote on the opportunities With multivoting you display opportunities on pages or flip chart sheets posted on the walls of the room where you re conducting your workshop Raters are given dots or other types of stickers to register their votes They simply apply their stickers to the opportunities they favor Another way that multivoting may be applied in the product development process is for choosing the most promising concepts See Chapter Concept Selection We recommend that you number the opportunities and ask voters to write the number of the opportunity they will vote for on each of their stickers They do this quietly as group before actually applying the stickers to the sheets Then everyone places their stickers simultaneously By this method you avoid influencing the voting decisions with information about how others have voted Workshops work well for reviewing up to about 50 opportunities For more than 50 we suggest first doing round of Web based screening Opportunity Identification 47 Regardless of which voting method you choose we suggest that you consider advancing not only the ideas receiving the most votes but also those with only few very enthusiastic supporters Strong opinions often point to exceptional ideas Remember that your goal is to efficiently eliminate opportunities that are not worthy of further investment but to avoid killing potentially great idea The FroliCat team had developed 50 raw opportunities as the result of the efforts of six individuals working independently and in brainstorming sessions The team members identified seven opportunities they felt were worthy of further development by aggregating the individual judgments of the team members including both product designers at Asentio and marketing managers at FroliCat Step Develop Promising Opportunities Rarely does it make sense to bet on single opportunity Too much uncertainty clouds the prospects for success After screening opportunities the team should invest modest levels of resources in developing few of them At minimum an opportunity passing the initial screen warrants an Internet search for existing solutions and an informal discussion with few potential customers Some additional tasks that are often worth completing include customer interviews testing of existing products concept generation quick prototypes and estimates of market sizes and growth rates You might invest few days to few weeks in each of several promising opportunities In developing promising opportunities the goal is to resolve the greatest uncertainty surrounding each one at the lowest cost in time and money One way to structure this step is to list the major uncertainties regarding the success of each opportunity the tasks you could take to resolve the uncertainties and the approximate cost of each task Then perform the tasks that resolve the most uncertainty at the lowest cost For example an opportunity based on clever concept might not be very valuable if patent is unlikely cursory patent search takes just couple of hours and so that is task that should be completed early in the process of developing the opportunity The FroliCat team explored the seven opportunities shown in Exhibit and selected three opportunities for further development The subsequent development tasks were to build functional prototypes and test them with cats and cat owners to create packaging concepts and test their appeal with consumers and to complete financial analysis based on likely manufacturing costs and price points Step Select Exceptional Opportunities Once handful of opportunities have been developed with modest investment of resources enough uncertainty should be resolved in order to pick the exceptional few opportunities that warrant significant investment in product development Chapter Concept Selection describes how to choose design concept by comparing alternatives against selection criteria The same basic method can be used to select product opportunities One specific approach used within established companies is the Real Win Worth it RWW method developed originally by 3M Day 2007 The name 48 Chapter Real Win Worth it summarizes the three questions an organization should attempt to answer when screening opportunities Is the opportunity real Is there real market that you can serve with the product Criteria here include market size potential pricing availability of technology and the likelihood the product can be delivered in the required volume at the required cost Can you win with this opportunity Can you establish sustainable competitive advantage Can you patent or brand the idea Are you more capable of executing it than competitors For example do you have superior engineering talent in this field Is the opportunity worth it financially Do you have the resources needed financial and developmental and are you confident that the investment will be rewarded with appropriate returns Exhibit 10 shows the RWW criteria applied to the swinging ball opportunity for FroliCat An analysis like this one done for each opportunity allows the team to narrow the opportunities to the exceptional few For FroliCat the swinging ball concept was highly appealing to potential purchasers was engaging for cats offered the prospect of good patent and could be developed and launched with modest investment These factors distinguished the opportunity from the others Real Win Worth it RWW Framework Swing Ball Cat Toy Example Is there real market and real product Is there need What is the need How is the need presently satisfied Yes Can the customer buy size of the market customer decision making process Yes Will the customer buy perceived risks and benefits expectations on price and availability Yes Is there viable concept for product already How likely are we to be able to develop viable concept Yes Is the product acceptable within the social legal and environmental norms Yes Is the product feasible Can it be made Is the technology available Does it satisfy the needs Yes Will our product satisfy the market Is there relative advantage to other products Yes Can it be produced at low cost Yes Are the risks perceived by the customer acceptable What are the barriers to adoption Answer YES Can we win Can our product or service be competitive Can we succeed as company Do we have competitive advantage Is it sustainable performance patents barriers to entry substitution price Yes Is the timing right Yes Does it fit our brand Yes Will we beat our competition How much will they improve price trajectories entrants Yes Do we have superior resources engineering finance marketing production fit with core competencies No Do we have the management that can win experience fit with culture commitment to this opportunity Yes Do we know the market as well as or better than our competitors customer behavior channels Answer YES Is it worth doing Is the return adequate and the risk acceptable Will it make money Yes Do we have the resources and the cash to do this Yes Are the risks acceptable to us What could go wrong technical risk vs market risk Yes Does it fit our strategy fit with our growth expectation impact on brand embedded options Answer YES EXHIBIT The Real Win Worth it criteria applied to the swinging ball opportunity The checklist is available from the book Web site Opportunity Identification 49 This same selection method can be applied using other criteria An entrepreneur starting new business will use different criteria from those of an established company For example in addition to or instead of the Real Win Worth it criteria an entrepreneur might select opportunities based on the amount of capital required the time required to get to market or the passion and excitement invoked by the opportunity Step Reflect on the Results and the Process The FroliCat team pursued the swing ball opportunity and developed product for sale Exhibit 11 which was named the Sway The Sway was launched through major retailers such as Amazon The team anxiously awaited the market response which would be key indicator of the success of their opportunity identification process However market success is not the only success criterion for the process Some questions to consider in reflecting on the opportunity identification results and process are How many of the opportunities identified came from internal sources versus external sources Did we consider dozens or hundreds of opportunities Was the innovation charter too narrowly focused Were our filtering criteria biased or largely based on the best possible estimates of eventual product success Are the resulting opportunities exciting to the team EXHIBIT The Sway cat toy product that resulted from the swinging ball opportunity 50 Chapter Summary This chapter articulates conceptual framework for opportunity identification as tournament in which large number of raw opportunities are generated and then filtered and explored in order to narrow those opportunities to an exceptional few The opportunity identification process includes six steps Establish charter Generate and sense many opportunities Screen opportunities Develop promising opportunities Select exceptional opportunities QP PP NI Reflect on the results and the process The performance of the opportunity identification process depends on considering large number of opportunities from variety of sources applying idea generation processes that result in good opportunities and in considering opportunities of widely varying quality By systematically filtering and developing large set of raw opportunities to identify an exceptional few
