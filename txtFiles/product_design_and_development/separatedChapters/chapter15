311312 Chapter 15 Ford Motor Company safety engineers were working with supplier to better understand the performance of rear seat belts In any conventional seat belt system with lap and shoulder belts if the lap portion of the belt rides upward the passenger may slide beneath it potentially resulting in abdominal injury This phenomenon called submarining is related to large number of factors including the nature of the collision the design of the vehicle the properties of the seats and seat belts and other conditions Based on experimentation simulation and analysis Ford engineers hoped to determine which of the many factors were most critical to passenger safety and to avoiding submarining The image shown in Exhibit 15 depicts the model used in Ford simulation analysis This chapter presents method for designing and conducting experiments to improve the performance of products even in the presence of uncontrollable variations This method is known as robust design What Is Robust Design We define robust product or process as one that performs as intended even under nonideal conditions such as manufacturing process variations or range of operating situations We use the term noise to describe uncontrolled variations that may affect performance and we say that quality product should be robust to noise factors Robust design is the product development activity of improving the desired performance of the product while minimizing the effects of noise In robust design we use experiments and data analysis to identify robust setpoints for the design parameters we can control robust setpoint is combination of design parameter values for which the product performance is as desired under range of operating conditions and manufacturing variations Conceptually robust design is simple to understand For given performance target safely restraining rear seat passengers for example there may be many combinations of parameter values that will yield the desired result However some of these combinations are more sensitive to uncontrollable variation than others Because the product will likely operate in the presence of various noise factors we would like to choose the combination of parameter values that is least sensitive to uncontrollable variation The robust design process uses an experimental approach to finding these robust setpoints To understand the concept of robust setpoints consider two hypothetical factors affecting some measure of seat belt performance as shown in Exhibit 15 Assmne that factor has linear effect fA on performance and factor has nonlinear effect fB Further consider that we can choose setpoints for each factor A1 or A2 for factor and B1 or B2 for factor Assuming that the effects of fA and f3 are additive combination of A1 and B2 will provide approximately the same level of overall performance as combination of A2 and B1 Manufacturing variations will be present at any chosen setpoint so that the actual value may not be exactly as specified By choosing the value of B1 for factor where the sensitivity of the response to factor is relatively small unintended variation in factor has relatively small influence on overall product performance Therefore the choice of B1 and A2 is more robust combination of setpoints than the combination of B2 and Al The robust design process can be used at several stages of the product development process As with most product development issues the earlier that robustness can be considered in the product development process the better the robustness results can be Robust Design 31 Response to fB Response to Factor Factor III A1 A2 Bl BZ EXHIBIT Robust design exploits nonlinear relationships to identify setpoints where the product performance is less sensitive to variations In this example the chosen value for the factor setpoint does not affect robustness whereas that of factor does Choosing Bl minimizes the effect of variation in factor on overall performance Robust design experiments can be used within the concept development phase as way to refine the specifications and set realistic performance targets While it is beneficial to consider product robustness as early as the concept stage experiments for robust design are used most frequently during the detail design phase as way to ensure the desired product performance under variety of conditions In detail design the robust design activity is also known as parameter design as this is matter of choosing the right setpoints for the design parameters under our control These include the product materials dimensions tolerances manufacturing processes and operating instructions For many engineering design problems equations based on fundamental physical principles can be solved for robust parameter choices However engineers generally cannot fully model the kinds of uncertainties variations and noise factors that arise under real conditions Furthermore the ability to develop accurate mathematical models is limited for many engineering problems For example consider the difficulty of accurately modeling the seat belt submarining problem under wide variety of conditions In such situations empirical investigation through designed experiments is necessary Such experiments can be used to directly support decision making and can also be used to improve the accuracy of mathematical models In the case of the seat belt design problem Ford engineers wished to test range of seat belt design parameters and collision conditions However crash testing is very expensive so Ford worked with its seat belt supplier to develop simulation model which was calibrated using experimental crash data Considering the hundreds of possible design parameter combinations collision conditions and other factors of interest the engineers chose to explore the simulation model using carefully planned experiment Although simulation requires great deal of computational effort the simulation model still allowed Ford engineers to run dozens of experiments under wide variety of conditions which would not have been possible using physical crash testing 314 Chapter 15 For the Ford seat belt design team the goals of this designed experiment were to learn What combination of seat seat belt and attachment parameters minimizes rear seat passenger submarining during crash How submarining is affected by uncontrollable conditions What combination of design parameters is most robust to such noise factors Design of Experiments The approach to robust design presented in this chapter is based on method called design of experiments DOE In this method the team identifies the parameters that can be controlled and the noise factors it wishes to investigate The team then designs conducts and analyzes experiments to help determine the parameter setpoints to achieve robust performance In Japan during the 1950s and 1960s Dr Genichi Taguchi developed techniques to apply DOE to improve the quality of products and manufacturing processes Beginning with the quality movement of the 1980s Taguchi approach to experimental design started to have an impact on engineering practice in the United States particularly at Ford Motor Company Xerox Corporation AT Bell Laboratories and through the American Supplier Institute which was created by Ford Taguchi receives credit for promoting several key ideas of experimental design for the development of robust products and processes These contributions include introducing noise factors into experiments to observe these effects and the use of Signal to noise ratio metric including both the desired performance signal and the undesired effects noise While statisticians had been showing engineers how to run experiments for decades it was not until Taguchi methods were widely explained to the US manufacturing industry during the 1990s that experiments became commonly utilized to achieve robust design DOE is not substitute for technical knowledge of the system under investigation In fact the team should use its understanding of the product and how it operates to choose the right parameters to investigate by experiment The experimental results can be used in conjunction with technical knowledge of the system in order to make the best choices of parameter setpoints Furthermore the experimental results can be used to build better mathematical models of the product function In this way experimentation complements technical knowledge For example Ford engineers have basic mathematical models of seat belt performance as function of passenger sizes and collision types These models allow Ford to size the mechanical elements and to determine the belt attachment geometry Based on empirical and simulation data Ford analytical models and seat belt design guidelines gain precision over time reducing the need for time consuming empirical and simulation studies Eventually this technical knowledge may improve to the point where only confirming tests of new seat belt configurations are required Basic experimental design and analysis for product development can be successfully planned and executed by the development team However the field of DOE has many advanced methods to address number of complicating factors and yield more useful experimental results Development teams thus can benefit from consulting with statistician or DOE expert who can assist in designing the experiment and choosing the best analytical approach Robust Design 31 The Robust Design Process To develop robust product through DOE we suggest this seven step process NQM 9NE Identify control factors noise factors and performance metrics Formulate an objective function Develop the experimental plan Run the experiment Conduct the analysis Select and confirm factor setpoints Reflect and repeat Step Identify Control Factors Noise Factors and Performance Metrics The robust design procedure begins with identification of three lists control factors noise factors and performance metrics for the experiment Control factors These are the design variables to be varied in controlled manner during the experiment in order to explore the product performance under the many combinations of parameter setpoints Experiments are generally run at two or three discrete levels setpoint values of each factor These parameters are called control factors because they are among the variables that can be specified for production and or operation of the product For example the webbing stiffness and coefficient of friction are control factors of interest for the experiment Noise factors Noise factors are variables that cannot be explicitly controlled during the manufacturing and operation of the product Noise factors may include manufacturing variances changes in materials properties multiple user scenarios or operating conditions and even deterioration or misuse of the product If through special techniques the team can control the noise factors during the experiment but not in production or operation then variance can deliberately be induced during the experiment to assess its impact Otherwise the team simply lets the noise take place during the experiment analyzes the results in the presence of typical variation and seeks to minimize the effects of this variation For seat belts to be used with range of seats the shape of the seat and the seat fabric must be considered noise factors The goal is to design seat belt system that works well regardless of the values of these factors Performance metrics These are the product specifications of interest in the experiment Usually the experiment is analyzed with one or two key product specifications as the performance metrics in order to find control factor setpoints to optimize this performance These metrics may be derived directly from key specifications where robustness is of critical concern See Chapter Product Specifications For example how far the passenger back or buttocks move forward during the collision would be possible performance metrics for the seat belt experiment For the seat belt design problem the team held meeting to list the control factors noise factors and performance metrics As Taguchi teaches they placed these lists into single graphic called parameter diagram or diagram as shown in Exhibit 15 316 Chapter 15 EXHIBIT Parameter diagram used to design the seat belt experiment Bold text indicates the performance metric used and the control factors and noise factors chosen for exploration Control Factors Passenger Performance Metrics Restraint Belt webbing stiffness Process Back angle Belt webbing friction Slip of buttocks Lap belt force limiter Hip rotation Forward knee motion Noise Factors Shape of rear seat Type of seat fabric Severity of collision Wear of components Positioning of passenger Positioning of belts on body Size of passenger Type of clothing fabric Web manufacturing variations Latch manufacturing variations Upper anchorage stiffness Buckle cable stiffness Front seatback bolster Tongue friction Attachment geometry After listing the various factors the team must decide which ones will be explored by experiment When large number of parameters are suspected of potentially affecting performance the selection of critical variables can be substantially narrowed by using analytical models and or by running screening experiment with two levels for each of many factors Then finer experiment is run with two or more levels of the few parameters believed to affect performance Ford engineers considered the lists shown in Exhibit 15 They chose to focus the experiment on exploration of seven seat belt parameters holding constant the geometric locations of the three attachment points They decided to use back angle at peak as the output metric the angle that the passenger back makes with respect to vertical at the moment of maximum restraint Back angle is smaller is better performance metric measured in radians primary concern in this experiment was the effect of three particular noise factors seat shape fabric type and severity of collision Through preliminary analysis the team found the best and worst combinations of these noise conditions with respect to the submarining effect These three noise factors were thereby combined into two extreme noise conditions for the purposes of the experiment This approach known as compounded noise can be helpful when many noise factors must be considered See Testing Noise Factors in step Step Formulate an Objective Function The experiment performance metric must be transformed into an objective function that relates to the desired robust performance Several objective functions are useful in robust design for different types of performance concerns They can be formulated either as functions to be maximized or minimized and they include Maximizing This type of function is used for performance dimensions where larger values are better such as maximum deceleration before belt slippage Common forms of this objective function are or where is the mean of the experimental observations under given test condition Robust Design 31 Minimizing This type of function is used for performance dimensions where smaller values are better such as back angle at peak deceleration Common forms of this objective function are or 02 where 02 is the variance of the experimental observations under given test condition Alternatively such minimization objectives can be formulated as functions to be maximized such as or 02 Target value This type of function is used for performance dimensions where values closest to desired setpoint or target are best such as amount of belt slackening before restraint common maximizing form of this objective function is where is the target value Signal to noise ratio This type of function is used particularly to measure robustness Taguchi formulates this metric as ratio with the desired response in the numerator and the variance in the response as the denominator Generally the mean value of the desired response such as the mean back angle at peak is not difficult to adjust by changing control factors In the denominator we place the variance of this response the noise response which is to be minimized such as the variance in back angle resulting from noise conditions In practice reducing variance is more difficult than changing the mean By computing this ratio we can highlight robust factor settings for which the noise response is relatively low as compared to the signal response common maximizing form of this objective function is 10 log pf 02 The Ford statistician consulting with the team suggested two objective functions the average back angle at peak and the range of the back angle at peak the difference between the maximum and minimum back angle at peak at the two noise conditions to be tested Both of these are objectives to be minimized Together these two metrics would provide deeper insight into the behavior of the system than either one alone Step Develop the Experimental Plan Statisticians have developed many types of efficient experimental plans These plans lay out how to vary the factor levels values of the control factors and possibly also some of the noise factors in series of experiments in order to explore the system behavior Some DOE plans are more efficient for characterizing certain types of systems while others provide more complete analysis Experimental Designs critical concern in designing experiments is the cost of setting up and running the experimental trials In situations where this cost is low running large number of trials and using an experimental design with resolution high enough to explore more factors factor combinations and interactions may be feasible On the other hand when the cost of experimentation is high efficient DOE plans can be used that simultaneously change several factors at once Some of the most popular experimental designs are listed below and depicted in Exhibit 15 Each one has important uses all factorial This design involves the systematic exploration of every combination of levels of each factor This allows the team to identify all of the multifactor interaction318 Chapter 15 Full Factorial Matrix Fractional Factorial Matrix A1 A2 A1 A2 B1 B2 B1 B2 B1 B2 B1 B2 C1 C2 C1 C2 C1 C2 C1 C2 C1 C2 C1

The full factorial experiment contains 27 128 trials While the L8 orthogonal array design contains only trials denoted by the marks in the matrices The L8 orthogonal array plan is the one used for the seat belt experiment and is shown in conventional row column format in Exhibit 15 Robust Design 31 effects in addition to the primary main effect of each factor on performance This type of experiment is generally practical only for small number of factors and levels and when experiments are inexpensive as with fast software based simulations or very flexible hardware For an investigation of factors at levels each the number of trials in the full factorial experiment is nk Full factorial experimentation is typically infeasible for an experiment with greater than four to five factors Fractional factorial This design uses only small fraction of the combinations used above In exchange for this efficiency the ability to compute the magnitudes of all the interaction effects is sacrificed Instead the interactions are confounded with other interactions or with some of the main factor effects Note that the fractional factorial layout still maintains balance within the experimental plan This means that for the several trials at any given factor level each of the other factors is tested at every level the same number of times Orthogonal array This design is the smallest fractional factorial plan that still allows the team to identify the main effects of each factor However these main effects are confounded with many interaction effects Nevertheless orthogonal array layouts are widely utilized in technical investigations because they are extremely efficient Taguchi popularized the orthogonal array DOE approach even though statisticians had developed such plans several decades earlier and the roots of these designs can be traced back many centuries Orthogonal array plans are named according to the number of rows experiments in the array L4 L8 L9 L27 and so on The appendix to this chapter shows several orthogonal array experimental plans One factor at time This is an unbalanced experimental plan because each trial is conducted with all but one of the factors at nominal levels and the first trial having all the factors at the nominal level This is generally considered to be an ineffective way to explore the factor space even though the number of trials is small However for parameter optimization in systems with significant interactions an adaptive version of the one at time experimental plan has been shown to be generally more efficient than orthogonal array plans Frey et al 2003 The Ford team chose to use the L8 orthogonal array experiment design because this plan would be an efficient way to explore seven factors at two levels each Subsequent rounds of experimentation could later be used to explore additional levels of key parameters as well as interaction effects if necessary The orthogonal array experimental plan is shown in Exhibit 15 Testing Noise Factors Several methods are used to explore the effects of noise factors in experiments If some noise factors can be controlled for the purpose of the experiment then it may be possible to directly assess the effect of these noise factors If the noise factors cannot be controlled during the experiment we allow the noise to vary naturally and simply assess the product performance in the presence of noise Some common ways to test noise factors are Assign additional columns in the orthogonal array or fractional factorial layout to the noise factors essentially treating the noise as another variable This allows the effects of the noise factors to be determined along with the control factors 320 Chapter 15 EXHIBIT Factor Description Factor

the bearing area of the tongue which slides Each row was along the Webblng replicated twice under the two compounded noise conditions yielding 16 test data points for analysis Use an outer array for the noise factors This method tests several combinations of the noise factors for each row in the main inner array An example of this approach is shown in the appendix where the outer array consists of an L4 design testing combinations of three noise factors by replicating each row four times Run replicates of each row allowing the noise to vary in natural uncontrolled manner throughout the experiment resulting in measurable variance in performance for each row With this approach it is particularly important to randomize the order of the trials so that any trends in the noise are unlikely to be correlated with the systematic changes in the control factors See step Run replicates of each row with compounded noise In this method selected noise factors are combined to create several representative noise conditions or extreme noise conditions This approach also yields measurable variance for each row which can be attributed to the effect of noise The Ford team chose to utilize the compounded noise approach in the seat belt experiment The team tested each row using the two combinations of the three noise factors representing the best and worst case conditions This resulted in 16 experimental runs for the L8 DOE plan as shown in Exhibit 15 Robust Design 321 Avg Range 3403 2915 3159 0488 4608 3984 4296 0624 3682 3627 3655 0055 2961 2647 2804 0314 4450 4398 4424

various treatment conditions described by each row in the experimental plan Randomizing the sequence of the experimental runs ensures that any systematic trend over the duration of the experiment is not correlated with the systematic changes to the levels of the factors For example if the experiments of the L8 plan are not randomized and the test conditions drift over time this effect may be incorrectly attributed to factor because this column changes halfway through the experiment For some experiments changing certain factors may be so difficult that all trials at each level of that factor are run together and only partial randomization may be achieved In practice randomize the trials whenever practical and when not possible validate the results with confirmation run See step In the seat belt experiment each of the eight factor combinations in the L8 design was tested under the two compounded noise conditions The 16 data points containing the back angle data are shown in Exhibit 15 in the columns titled and Step Conduct the Analysis There are many ways to analyze the experimental data For all but the most basic analysis the team benefits from consulting with DOE expert or from referring to good book on statistical analysis and experimental design The basic analytical method is summarized here Computing the Objective Function The team will have already devised the objective functions for the experiment and will generally have an objective related to the mean performance and the variance in performance Sometimes the mean and variance will be combined and expressed as single objective in the form of signal to noise ratio The values of the objective function can be computed for each row of the experiment For the seat belt experiment the colLunns on the right side of the table in Exhibit 15 show the computed objective function values average back angle and range of back angle for each row Recall that these are both objectives to be minimized 322 Chapter 15 EXHIBIT Factor effects charts for the seat belt experiment Computing Factor Effects by Analysis of Means The most straightforward analysis to conduct will simply yield the main effect of each factor assigned to column in the experiment These main effects are called the factor eflects The analysis of means involves simply averaging all the computed objective functions for each factor level In the L8 DOE example the effect of factor level Al factorA at level is the average of trials and Similarly the effect of factor level E2 is the average of trials and The results of an analysis of means are conventionally shown on factor effects charts Exhibit 15 presents the factor effects charts for the seat belt example These effects are plotted for each of the objective functions Exhibit 15 plots the average performance at each factor level the first objective function This chart shows which factor levels can be used to raise or lower the mean performance Recall that back angle at peak is to be minimized and note that the chart suggests that factor levels A1 B2 C2 El Fl Gl will 44 42 G2 40 A2 B1 C1 38 D1 D2 E2 F2 34E 34E 36 BZ C2 A1 34 G1 32 30 Control Factors 05 75 C1 04 A1 D2

necessarily achieve robust performance Exhibit 15 is based on the range of performance at each factor level the second objective function This chart suggests that levels A2 B2 C2 D1 E1 F2 G1 will minimize the range of back angle at peak Taguchi recommends that the signal to noise ratio for each factor level be plotted in order to identify robust setpoints Because the signal to noise ratio includes the mean performance in the numerator and the variance in the denominator it represents combination of these two objectives or trade off between them Rather than specifically plotting the signal tonoise ratio many engineers and statisticians prefer to simply interpret the two objectives together giving more control over the trade off To do so the factor effects charts shown in Exhibit 15 can be compared in order to choose robust setpoint in the next step Step Select and Confirm Factor Setpoints Analysis of means and the factor effects charts help the team determine which factors have strong effect on mean performance and variance and therefore how to achieve robust performance These charts help to identify which factors are best able to reduce the product variance robustness factors and which factors can be used to improve the performance scaling factors By choosing setpoints based on these insights the team should be able to improve the overall robustness of the product For example consider the effects of factor on both average and range of back angle in the experiment The charts in Exhibit 15 show that level A1 would minimize back angle but level A2 would minimize the range of back angle representing trade off between performance and robustness similar trade off is evident in factor However for factors and there is no such trade off and levels B2 C2 D1 E1 and G1 minimize both objectives Using factors and to achieve the desired robustness and factors and to increase performance Ford engineers selected the setpoint A1 B2 C2 D1 E1 F1 G1 As is usually the case the chosen setpoint is not one of the eight orthogonal array rows tested in the experiment Given that this setpoint has never been tested confirmation run should be used to ensure that the expected robust performance has been achieved Step Reflect and Repeat One round of experiments may be sufficient to identify appropriately robust setpoints Sometimes however further optimization of the product performance is worthwhile and this may require several additional rounds of experimentation In subsequent experimentation and testing the team may choose to Reconsider the setpoints chosen for factors displaying trade off of performance versus robustness Explore interactions among some of the factors in order to further improve the performance Fine tune the parameter setpoints using values between the levels tested or outside this range 324 Chapter 15 Caveats Investigate other noise and or control factors that were not included in the initial experiment As with all product development activities the team should take some time to reflect on the DOE process and the robust design result Did we run the right experiments Did we achieve an acceptable result Could it be better Should we repeat the process and seek further performance robustness improvement Design of experiments is well established field of expertise This chapter summarizes only one very basic approach in order to encourage the use of experimentation in product design to achieve more robust product performance Most product development teams should include team members with DOE training or have access to engineers and or statisticians with specialized expertise in design and analysis of experiments Obviously many assumptions underlie the type of analysis used in DOE One basic assumption made in interpreting analysis of means is that the factor effects are independent without interactions across the factors In fact most actual systems exhibit many interactions but these interactions are often smaller than the main effects Verification of this assumption is another motive for running confirming experiments at the chosen setpoints If necessary experiments can be designed to specifically test interaction effects This type of experiment is outside the scope of this chapter DOE texts generally provide number of ways to explore interactions across the factors including the following Assign specific interactions to be explored in certain columns of the orthogonal array instead of using the column for control factor Execute larger fractional factorial design Use an adaptive one at time experimental plan Frey et al 2003 Many advanced graphical and analytical techniques are available to assist in interpretation of the experimental data Analysis of variance ANOVA provides way to assess the significance of the factor effects results in light of the experimental error observed in the data ANOVA takes into account the number of observations made of each degree of freedom in the experiment and the scale of the results to determine whether each effect is statistically significant This helps determine to what extent detailed design decisions should be based on the experimental results However ANOVA makes many more assumptions and can be difficult to set up properly so it is also beyond the scope of this chapter Refer to DOE text Ross 1996 Montgomery 2007 or consult with DOE expert to assist with ANOVA Summary Robust design is set of engineering design methods used to create robust products and processes robust product or process is one that performs properly even in the presence of noise effects Noises are due to many kinds of uncontrolled variation that may affectRobust Design 325 performance such as manufacturing variations operating conditions and product

array experimental plans provide very efficient method for exploring the main effects of each factor chosen for the experiment To achieve robust performance use of objective functions helps in capturing both mean performance due to each control factor and variance of performance due to noise factors Analysis of means and factor effects charts facilitate the choice of robust parameter

Arrays DOE texts provide several orthogonal array plans for experiments The simplest arrays are for two level and three level factor experiments Using advanced techniques DOE plans can also be created
