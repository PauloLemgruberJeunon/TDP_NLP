 229230 Chapter 12 EXHIBIT The spine of the Setu chair is combination of two polypropylene materials precisely engineered to flex and support as the user moves in the chair In June 2009 Herman Miller Inc based office furniture manufacturer launched the Setu multipurpose chair The Setu named after the Hindi word for bridge aims to set new standards of simplicity adaptability and comfort for multipurpose seating while being environmentally friendly The Setu chair is one product in very successful line of office seating including also the Aeron and Mirra chairs shown in Exhibit 12 Herman Miller designed the Setu chair in collaboration with Studio design firm based in Germany Multipurpose chairs such as the Setu are used where people sit for relatively short periods such as conference rooms temporary workstations and collaborative spaces This is in contrast to task chair in which the user sits for longer periods Studio found that many chairs in office spaces where people spend from few minutes to few hours at time were uncomfortable and misadjusted Moreover most chairs are made with materials and processes that are harmful to the environment Studio recognized market need for new and innovative multipurpose chair one combining comfort design for environment and compelling price The core of Setu is flexible spine molded of two polypropylene materials and engineered to achieve comfort for nearly everybody see Exhibit 12 As the user sits and reclines the spine flexes providing comfort and back support throughout the full range of tilt Without any tilt mechanism and with only one adjustment height the chair is significantly lighter weight less complex and lower cost than the Aeron and Mirra task chairs The Setu chair emerged from Herman Miller commitment to minimizing the environmental impacts of their products and operations and provides great example of how to incorporate environmental considerations into the product development process The Setu is designed for material recycling and is produced using environmentally safe materials and renewable energy The following factors explain its level of environmental performance Environmentally friendly materials The Setu multipurpose chair consists of environmentally safe and nontoxic materials such as 41 percent by weight aluminum 41 percent polypropylene and 18 percent steel Courtesy of Herman Miller Inc Design for Environment 231 Recycled content The Setu is made of 44 percent recycled materials by weight comprising 23 percent postconsumer and 21percent postindustrial recycled content Recyclabilitjy The Setu is 92 percent recyclable by weight at the end of its useful life Steel and aluminum components are 100 percent recyclable Polypropylene components are identified with recycling code whenever possible to aid in returning these materials to the recycling stream Of course recycling of industrial materials depends on the availability of such recycling streams Clean energy Setu is manufactured on production line that utilizes 100 percent green power half from wind turbines and half from captured landfill off gassing Emissions No harmful air or water emissions are released during Setu production Returnable and recyclable packaging Setu components are received by Herman Miller from network of nearby suppliers in molded tote trays that are returned to the suppliers for reuse Outgoing packaging materials include corrugated cardboard and polyethylene plastic bag both materials capable of repeated recycling Design for environment DFE is way to include environmental considerations in the product development process This chapter presents method for DFE using the Herman Miller Setu chair as an example to illustrate the successful application of the DFE process What Is Design for Environment Every product has environmental impacts DFE provides organizations with practical method to minimize these impacts in an effort to create more sustainable society Just as effective design for manufacturing DFM practice has been shown to maintain or improve product quality while reducing costs see Chapter 13 Design for Manufacturing practitioners of DFE have also found that effective DFE practice can maintain or improve product quality and cost while reducing environmental impacts Environmental impacts of product may include energy consumption natural resource depletion liquid discharges gaseous emissions and solid waste generation These impacts fall into two broad categories energy and materials and both represent critical environmental problems that need to be solved For most products addressing the energy problem means developing products that use less energy and that use renewable energy To address the materials problem is not as straightforward Therefore much of the focus of DFE in this chapter is on choosing the right materials for products and making sure they can be recycled During the early stages of the product development process deliberate decisions about material use energy efficiency and waste avoidance can minimize or eliminate environmental impacts However once the design concept is established improving environmental performance generally involves time consuming design iterations DFE therefore may involve activities throughout the product development process and requires an interdisciplinary approach Industrial design engineering purchasing and marketing all work together in the development of environmentally friendly products In many cases product development professionals with specialized DFE training lead the DFE efforts within project However all product development team members benefit from understanding the principles of DFE 232 Chapter 12 EXHIBIT The natural life cycle and the product life cycle Two Life Cycles Life cycle thinking is the basis of DFE This helps to expand the traditional manufacturer concern with the production and distribution of its products to comprise closedloop system relating the product life cycle to the natural life cycle both of which are illustrated in Exhibit 12 The product life cycle begins with the extraction and processing of raw materials from natural resources followed by production distribution and use of the product Finally at the end of the product useful life there are several recovery options remanufacturing or reuse of components recycling of materials or disposal through incineration or deposit in landfill The natural life cycle represents the growth and decay of organic materials in continuous loop The two life cycles intersect as shown in the diagram with the use of natural materials in industrial products and with the reintegration of organic materials back into the natural cycle While most product life cycles take place over few months or years the natural cycle spans wider range of time periods Most organic materials plant and animal based can decay relatively quickly and become nutrients for new growth of similar materials However other natural materials such as minerals are created on much longer time scale and so are considered to be nonrenewable natural resources Therefore depositing most mineral based industrial materials into landfills does not readily re create similar industrial materials for perhaps thousands of years and often creating unnatural concentrations of certain harmful wastes Each of the product life cycle stages may consume energy and other resources and may generate emissions and waste all of which have environmental impacts From this life cycle perspective in order to reach conditions of environmental sustainability the materials in products must be balanced in sustainable closed loop system This gives rise to three challenges of product design to reach sustainability which are also represented in the life cycle diagram of Exhibit 12 Nonrenewable Resources Recycling fl Production Postindustrial Renewable Materials esources Resources Postconsumer Remanufacturing Natural Recycling Biological Product Natural Life Cycle Decay us rIa Life Cycle Distribution Recovery OXICS Reuse Organics lnorganics Use DepositDesign for Environment 233 Eliminate use of nonrenewable natural resources including nonrenewable sources of energy Eliminate disposal of synthetic and inorganic materials that do not decay quickly Eliminate creation of toxic wastes that are not part of natural life cycles Organizations committed to DFE intend to work toward achieving these sustainability conditions over time DFE helps these organizations to create better products by choosing materials carefully and by enabling proper recovery options so that the materials used in products can be reintegrated either into the product life cycle or into the natural life cycle Environmental Impacts Every product may have number of environmental impacts over its life cycle The following list explains some of the environmental impacts deriving from the manufacturing sector adapted from Lewis et al 2001 Global warming Scientific data and models show that the temperature of the earth is gradually increasing as result of the accumulation of greenhouse gases particulates and water vapor in the upper atmosphere This effect appears to be accelerating as result of emissions of carbon dioxide C02 methane CH4 chlorofluorocarbons CFCs black carbon particles and nitrogen oxides NOX from industrial processes and products Resource depletion Many of the raw materials used for production such as iron ore gas oil and coal are nonrenewable and supplies are limited Solid waste Products may generate solid waste throughout their life cycle Some of this waste is recycled but most is disposed in incinerators or landfills Incinerators generate air pollution and toxic ash which goes into landfills Landfills may also create concentrations of toxic substances generate methane gas CH4 and release groundwater pollutants Water pollution The most common sources of water pollution are discharges from industrial processes which may include heavy metals fertilizers solvents oils synthetic substances acids and suspended solids Waterborne pollutants may affect groundwater drinking water and fragile ecosystems Air pollution Sources of air pollution include emissions from factories powergenerating plants incinerators residential and commercial buildings and motor vehicles Typical pollutants include C02 NOX sulfur dioxide 02 ozone 03 and volatile organic compounds VOCs Land degradation Land degradation concerns the adverse effects that raw material extraction and production such as mining farming and forestry have on the environment The effects include reduced soil fertility soil erosion salinity of land and water and deforestation Biodiversity Biodiversity concerns the variety of plant and animal species and is affected by land clearing for urban development mining and other industrial activities Ozone depletion The ozone layer protects the earth against the harmful effects of the sun radiation It is degraded by reactions with nitric acid created by the burning of fossil fuels and chorine compounds such as CFCs 234 Chapter 12 History of Design for Environment The birth of DFE is often traced to the early 1970s Papanek 1971 challenged designers to face their social and environmental responsibilities instead of only commercial interests The World Commission on Environment and Development Brandtland Report 1987 first defined the term sustainable development as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs In the 1990s several influential books about environmentally friendly design were published Burall 1991 argued that there was no longer conflict between green approach to design and business success Fiksel 1996 revised 2009 discussed how DFE integrates life cycle thinking into new product and process development As the DFE process matured Brezet and van Hemel 1997 provided practical guide called Ecodesign Also in the 1990s the Technical University of Delft Philips Electronics and the Dutch government collaborated to develop life cycle analysis software tool providing metrics to assess the overall environmental impact of product Today sustainable development movement embraces the broader concept of sustainable product design Bhamra and Lofthouse 2007 which includes not only DFE but also the social and ethical implications of products Even though authors have used various terminology for environmentally friendly design approaches the terms green design ecodesign sustainable design and DFE are more or less synonymous today Herman Miller Journey toward Design for Environment Many manufacturing firms have begun to embrace DFE However few have done so to the extent of Herman Miller where DFE is central to its corporate strategy Herman Miller strives to maintain high product quality standards while incorporating increasingly more environmentally friendly materials manufacturing processes and product function into every new product design In 1999 Herman Miller formed design for environment DFE team This team is responsible for developing environmentally sensitive design standards for new and existing Herman Miller products McDonough Braungart Design Chemistry MBDC product and industrial process design firm based in Virginia supports the DFE team in its mission McDonough and Braungart 2002 stated in their book Cradle to Cradle Remaking the Way We Make Things that the traditional DFE approach designing products that are merely less harmful to the environment due to incremental improvements such as reduced energy use waste generation or use of toxic materials is not sufficient because such products are still unhealthy for the environment To advance from less harmful to truly environmentally friendly products McDonough and Braungart introduced DFE method that focuses on three key areas of product design Material chemistry What chemicals comprise the specified materials Are they safe for humans and the environment Disassembly Can the products be taken apart at the end of their useful life in order to recycle their materials Recyclability Do the materials contain recycled content Are the materials readily separable into recycling categories Can the materials be recycled at the end of the product useful life Design for Environment 235 To implement DFE Herman Miller has built team of DFE experts who work on every new product development team With MBDC they have created materials database and DFE assessment tool which provide metrics to guide design decisions throughout the product development process The Design for Environment Process EXHIBIT The DFE process involves activities throughout the product development process Effective implementation of DFE includes activities throughout the product development process The steps of the DFE process are shown in Exhibit 12 Despite the linear presentation of the steps product development teams will likely repeat some steps several times making DFE an iterative process The following sections describe each step of the DFE process Product Planning Concept Development System Level Design Set DFE Agenda Identify Potential Environmental Impacts Select DFE Guidelines Apply DFE Guidelines to Initial Designls Detail Design Assess Environmental Impacts Compare to DFE Goals Refine Design Process Improvement Reflect on DFE Process and Results236 Chapter 12 Step Set the DFE Agenda Drivers Goals and Team The DFE process begins as early as the product planning phase with setting the DFE agenda This step consists of three activities identifying the internal and external drivers of DFE setting the environmental goals for the product and setting up the DFE team By setting the DFE agenda the organization identifies clear and actionable path toward environmentally friendly product design Identify the Internal and External Drivers of DFE The planning phase of DFE begins with discussion of the reasons why the organization wishes to address the environmental performance of its products It is useful to document both the internal drivers and the external drivers of DFE This list may evolve over time as changes in technology regulation experience stakeholders and competition each affect the capability and challenges of the organization Internal drivers are the DFE objectives within the organization Typical internal drivers of DFE are adapted from Brezet and van Hemel 1997 Product quality focus on environmental performance may raise the quality of the product in terms of functionality reliability in operation durability and repairability Public image Communicating high level of environmental quality of product can improve company image Cost reduction Using less material and less energy in production can result in considerable cost savings Generating less waste and eliminating hazardous waste results in lower waste disposal costs Innovation Sustainable thinking can lead to radical changes in product design and may foster innovation across the whole company Operational safety By eliminating toxic materials many DFE changes can help improve the occupational health and safety of employees Employee motivation Employees can be motivated to contribute in new and creative ways if they are able to help reduce the environmental impacts of the company products and operations Ethical responsibility Interest in sustainable development among managers and product developers may be motivated in part by moral sense of responsibility for conserving the environment and nature Consumer behavior Wider availability of products with positive environmental benefits may accelerate the transition to cleaner lifestyles and demand for greener products External drivers of DFE typically include environmental regulations customer preferences and the offerings of competitors such as from Brezet and van Hemel 1997 Environmental legislation Product oriented environmental policy is developing rapidly Companies must not only understand the myriad regulations in the various regions where they operate and sell products but also be able to anticipate futureDesign for Environment 237 legislation The focus of recent legislation is shifting from the prohibition of certain materials to broader producer responsibility including take back obligations Market demand Today companies operate in business environment of increasingly well informed industrial customers and end users who may demand sustainable products Negative publicity blogs and boycotts of products manufacturers or retailers can have considerable impact on sales Of course the opposite positive effect is becoming more powerful as well Competition Sustainability activities undertaken by competitors can lead to pressure for more emphasis on DFE Setting high environmental standard may create firstmover advantage Trade organizations Trade or industrial organizations in some branches of industry such as packaging and automobile manufacturing encourage companies to take environmental action by sharing technology and establishing codes of conduct Suppliers Suppliers influence company behavior by introducing more sustainable materials and processes Companies may choose to audit and confirm environmental declarations of their suppliers Social pressures Through their social and community contacts managers and employees may be asked about the responsibility that their business takes for the environment Key DFE drivers for the Setu chair were market demand innovation and Herman Miller commitment to environmental responsibility Studio and Herman Miller developed the early Setu concepts with these drivers in mind Set the DFE Goals An important activity in the product planning phase is to set the environmental goals for each product development project Many organizations have established strategy that includes long term environmental goals These goals define how the organization complies with environmental regulations and how the organization reduces the environmental impacts of its products services and operations In 2005 Herman Miller set its long term environmental goals for the year 2020 Zero landfill Zero hazardous waste generation Zero harmful air emissions Zero process water use All green electrical energy use All buildings certified to meet environmental efficiency standards All sales from products created with the DFE process To achieve the long term goals specific environmental goals may be set for every product during the planning phase These individual goals also allow the organization to make progress toward the long term strategy Exhibit 12 lists examples of DFE goals arranged according to the product life cycle Based on an understanding of which life cycle stages contribute significant environmental impacts goals may be developed accordingly 238 Chapter 12 EXHIBIT Example DFE goals arranged according to the product life cycle stages Adapted from Giudice et al 2006 Life Cycle Stage Example Design for Environment Goals Reduce the use of raw materials Choose plentiful renewable raw materials Eliminate toxic materials Increase the energy efficiency of material extraction processes Reduce discards and waste Increase the use of recovered and recycled materials Materials Production Reduce the use of process materials Specify process materials that can be fully recovered and recycled Eliminate toxic process materials Select processes with high energy efficiency Reduce production scrap and waste Distribution Plan the most energy efficient shipping Reduce emissions from transport Eliminate toxic and dangerous packaging materials Eliminate or reuse packaging Use Extend useful product life Promote use of products under the intended conditions Enable clean and efficient servicing operations Eliminate emissions and reduce energy consumption during use Recovery Facilitate product disassembly to separate materials Enable the recovery and remanufacturing of components Facilitate material recycling Reduce waste volume for incineration and landfill deposit Herman Miller understands that the primary environmental impacts of their office furniture products are in the materials production and recovery stages For the Setu chair Herman Miller aimed to use exclusively materials with low environmental impact facilitate product disassembly and enable recycling Set Up the DFE Team DFE requires participation by many functional experts on the product development project The typical composition of DFE team often subteam within the overall project team consists of DFE leader an environmental chemistry and materials expert manufacturing engineer and representative from the purchasing and supply chain organization Of course the DFE team composition depends on the organization and needs of the specific project and may also include marketing professionals outside consultants suppliers or other experts Herman Miller created their DFE team in 1999 to work with the designers and engineers on every product development project to review material chemistry disassembly recyclability incoming and outgoing packaging energy sources and uses and waste generation The DFE team is involved as early as possible to ensure that DFE considerationsDesign for Environment 239 are taken into account right from the start By working closely with each product development team the DFE team provides the tools and knowledge for making environmentally sound design decisions Step Identify Potential Environmental Impacts Environmental Impacts biodiversity due to deforestation Land degradation from factory methane and Emissions and Water pollution Air pollution due groundwater waste generation from factory to transportation Maintenance and pollutants from mining discharges emissions cleaning materials Incineration Natural resource Waste generation Waste generation Abrasion of generates air depletion during production from packaging materials pollution and Within the concept development phase DFE begins by identifying the potential environmental impacts of the product over its life cycle This enables the product development team to consider environmental impacts at the concept stage even though little or no specific data regarding material and energy use emissions and waste generation are yet available for the actual product and detailed environmental impact assessment is not yet possible In the case of product redesign however relevant data may be provided by impact analysis of some existing products See life cycle assessment methods in step below Exhibit 12 shows chart that can be used to qualitatively assess the environmental impacts over the product life cycle The chart is an adaption of the LiDS Wheel Brezet and van Hemel 1997 and the EcoDesign Web Bhamra and Lofthouse 2007 To create this chart the team asks What are the significant sources of potential environmental impact in each life cycle stage Specific questions for each stage are given in Exhibit 12 and may be helpful in conducting this qualitative analysis The team lists for each life cycle stage the anticipated key environmental impacts The height of each bar in the chart represents the team judgment about the overall magnitude of the potential environmental impacts and therefore where to focus their DFE efforts For some products automobiles electronic devices the most significant impacts are found to be in the use stage For other products clothing office furniture the greatest impacts may be in the materials production and recovery stages Exhibit 12 shows qualitative life cycle assessment for office furniture in general This understanding guided DFE in the Setu chair project Waste generation during recovery Reduced process Landfill leads to Air pollution land degradation due to mining emissions Landfill generates Life Cycle toxic ash Materials Production Distribution Use Recovery EXHIBIT The qualitative life cycle assessment represents the team estimate of the potential types and magnitudes of environmental impacts of the product over its life cycle This chart depicts the types of impacts most relevant to office furniture products such as the Setu chair 240 Chapter 12 Life Cycle Stage Questions Materials ow much and what types of recyclable materials will be used ow much and what types of non recyclable materials will be used ow much and what types of additives will be used What is

auxiliary materials and energy will be required What will be the aesthetic lifetime of the product Recovery How can the product be reused Will the components or materials be reused Can the product be quickly disassembled using common tools What materials will be recyclable Will recyclable materials be identifiable How will the product be disposed EXHIBIT Typical questions for consideration of the environmental impacts of each life cycle stage Adapted from Brezet and van Hemel 1997 Step Select DFE Guidelines Guidelines help product design teams to make early DFE decisions without the type of detailed environmental impact analysis that is only possible after the design is more fully specified Relevant guidelines may be selected based in part on the qualitative assessment of life cycle impacts from step Selecting relevant guidelines during the concept development phase allows the product development team to apply them throughout the product development project Exhibit 12 shows compilation of DFE guidelines based on study by Telenko et al 2008 Each life cycle stage has its own DFE guidelines that provide product development teams with instructions on how to reduce the environmental impacts of product more detailed list of DFE guidelines is provided in the appendix to this chapter Many of the guidelines relate to selection of materials This underscores the central role of materials in DFE Design for Environment 241 Life Cycle Stage Design for Environment Guidelines Materials Sustainability of resources Specify renewable and abundant resources Specify recyclable and or recycled materials Specify renewable forms of energy Healthy inputs and outputs Specify nonhazardous materials Install protection against release of pollutants and hazardous substances Include labels and instructions for safe handling of toxic materials Production Minimal use of resources in production Employ as few manufacturing steps as possible Specify materials that do not require surface treatments or coatings Minimize the number of components Specify lightweight materials and components Distribution Minimal use of resources in distribution Minimize packaging Use recyclable and or reusable packaging materials Employ folding nesting or disassembly to distribute products in compact state Apply structural techniques and materials to minimize the total volume of material Use Efficiency of resources during use Implement default power down for subsystems that are not in use Use feedback mechanisms to indicate how much energy or water are being consumed Implement intuitive controls for resource saving features Appropriate durability Consider aesthetics and functionality to ensure the aesthetic life is equal to the technical life Facilitate repair and upgrading Ensure minimal maintenance Minimize failure modes Recovery Disassembly separation and purification Ensure that joints and fasteners are easily accessible Specify joints and fasteners so that they are separable by hand or with common tools Ensure that incompatible materials are easily separated EXHIBIT Design for environment guidelines arranged according to the life cycle stage of product Based on Telenko et al 2008 Guidelines used in the Setu project are identified with an asterisk 242 Chapter 12 For the Setu project the DFE experts provided the product development team with several guidelines These guidelines are identified with an asterisk in Exhibit 12 Step Apply the DFE Guidelines to the Initial Product Design EXHIBIT The Setu spine was inspired by the human backbone As the product architecture is developed during the system level design phase see Chapter 10 Product Architecture some initial material choices are made along with some of the module design decisions It is beneficial therefore to apply the relevant DFE guidelines selected in step at this point In this way the initial product design may have lower environmental impacts The Setu team wanted the chair to be lightweight in order to reduce materials use and transportation impacts application of the DFE guideline Specify lightweight materials and components They achieved this by developing concept and product architecture that avoided an under seat tilt mechanism and other complexities This helped to reduce the chairs weight by as much as 20 pounds kg The Setu team also looked for new ways to ease the disassembly of the Setu in order to facilitate recycling They placed each joint where it is easily accessible and also ensured that Setu components are separable by hand or with common tools application of the DFE guidelines Ensure that joints and fasteners are easily accessible Specify joints and fasteners so that they are separable by hand or with common tools In the detail design phase the exact materials specifications detailed geometry and manufacturing processes are determined Application of the DFE guidelines in detail design is essentially the same as in system level design however at this point many more decisions are being made and environmental factors can be considered with greater precision By specifying low impact materials and reducing energy consumption product development teams create more environmentally friendly products Furthermore the DFE guidelines may inspire product development teams to come up with improvement in the functionality and durability of the product which may lead to significant lower environmental impacts The Setu spine geometry shown in Exhibit 12 was inspired by the human backbone Studio designers prototyped many iterations of the spine in order to achieve proper support and recline see Exhibit 12 10 Once the shape of the spine was set the team had to find materials that suited both the functional and environmental requirements Courtesy of Studio and Herman Miller Inc EXHIBIT The design team prototyped many variations of Setu spine and related components Design for Environment 243 Courtesy of Studio and Herman Miller Inc To specify materials that fit the environmental and functional requirements the development team used Herman Miller proprietary materials database The database maintained together with MBDC considers the safety and environmental impacts of each material and classifies them into one of four categories green little to no hazard yellow low to moderate hazard orange incomplete data and red high hazard Herman Miller aim was to use only materials that rank yellow or green for all new products For example polyvinyl chloride PVC is classified as red material PVC is polymer that is commonly used in fumiture and other products due to its low cost and high strength However both the production and the incineration of PVC releases toxic emissions To avoid using materials that are toxic to humans and the environment application of the DFE guideline Specify nonhazardous materials the engineers specified safer materials such as polypropylene and avoided PVC entirely Step Assess the Environmental Impacts The next step is to assess to the extent possible the environmental impacts of the product over its entire life cycle To do so with precision requires detailed understanding of how the product is to be produced distributed used over its lifetime and recycled or disposed244 Chapter 12 at the end of its useful life This assessment is generally done on the basis of the detailed bill of materials BOM including sources of energy component material specifications suppliers transportation modes waste streams recycling methods and disposal means Several quantitative life cycle assessment LCA tools are available to conduct such an environmental assessment These tools range in price and complexity and would be selected based on the types of materials and processes involved and the precision required of the analysis LCA requires significant amount of time training and data Many LCA analyses are comparative and provide basis for considering the environmental performance of product design alternatives Commercial LCA software is becoming widely used in product design and supporting data are available for common materials production processes transport methods energy generation processes and disposal scenarios Herman Miller uses their own proprietary DFE assessment tool developed for them by MBDC The DFE tool consists of spreadsheet interface and the materials database using the color coding described above The tool considers four factors for each component in the product Material chemistry Fraction of the materials by weight that are the safest possible in terms of human toxicity and environmental concerns Recycled content Fraction of the materials by weight that are postindustrial or postconsumer recycled content Disassembly Fraction of the materials by weight that can be readily disassembled Recyclability Fraction of the materials by weight that are recyclable Once the initial Setu design was established the chair was divided into modules with different teams assigned to develop each module As each team designed their module the DFE team assessed the design using the DFE tool Compare the Environmental Impacts to DFE Goals This step compares the environmental impacts of the evolving design to the DFE goals established in the planning phase If several design options were created in the detaildesign phase they may now be compared to judge which one has the lowest environmental impacts Unless the product development team is very experienced in DFE the design will generally have much room for improvement Usually several DFE iterations are required before the team is satisfied that the product is as good as it should be from DFE perspective Step Refine the Product Design to Reduce or Eliminate the Environmental Impacts The objective of this step and subsequent DFE iterations is to reduce or eliminate any significant environmental impacts through redesign The process repeats until the environmental impacts have been reduced to an acceptable level and the environmental performance fits the DFE goals Redesign for ongoing improvement of DFE may also continue after production begins For the Aeron and Mirra chairs shown in Exhibit 12 HermanEXHIBIT The final design of the Setu spine left and aluminum base right Design for Environment 245 Courtesy of Herman Miller Inc Miller made several modifications to materials specifications and sources since the initial release of these products reducing their environmental impacts After several design iterations the Setu team developed way to co mold the spine using two different polypropylene materials that are compatible for recycling without separation The inner and outer rails of the spine are made of polypropyleneand glass composite while the connecting spokes are molded using more flexible polypropylene and rubber composite see Exhibit 12 11 Setu aluminum base is an example of minimal design Uncoated and unpolished with no finishing labor and no harmful toxins it is durable and has less environmental impacts than traditionally finished chair bases One of the difficult trade offs addressed in the development of Setu was related to selection of materials for the arms of the chair While they were determined to avoid using PVC the team was not able to mold the arms using all olefinic materials such as polypropylene due to concerns of durability and fatigue failure The Setu arms therefore were molded from nylon and over molded with thermoplastic elastomer Because these materials are not chemically compatible for recycling this decision limited the chair overall recyclability Step Reflect on the DFE Process and Results As with every aspect of the product development process the final activity is to ask How well did we execute the DFE process How can our DFE process be improved What DFE improvements can be made on derivative and future products 246 Chapter 12 DFE Assessment Factor Setu Score Factor Weight Weighted Score Material Chemistry 50 33 16 Recycled Content 44 Disassembly 86 33 28 Recyclability 92 25 23 Overall Score 100 72 EXHIBIT Herman Miller DFE assessment tool considers four factors and computes the weighted overall score of 72 percent for the Setu chair Based on Herman Miller DFE assessment tool on scale of to 100 percent with 100 percent being truly cradle to cradle product the Setu chair achieved rating of 72 percent as shown in Exhibit 12 12 The Setu team was pleased with the chair in terms of ease of disassembly and feasibility of recycling Over the course of developing the Setu the chair recyclability score moved up and down and eventually dropped from 99 percent to 92 percent due to the material selection trade off in design of the arms One very important achievement made during the development of the Setu to enable its recyclability was change in the spine materials Early iterations used dissimilar materials bonded together which could not be recycled The DFE team challenged the Setu team to innovate further The resulting solution is constructed of two materials that are compatible for recycling without separation Unfortunately such solution could not be developed for the Setu arms and incompatible bonded materials were used there While highly successful in terms of implementing DFE the Setu chair still had some negative environmental impacts particularly in terms of material chemistry and use of recycled content as shown in Exhibit 12 12 This reflects the reality that creating perfect product from DFE perspective is goal that may take years to achieve Effective DFE requires product development team that strives for continuous improvement The DFE team may be able to further develop the Setu chair to reduce some of the known impacts For example molding the Setu arms entirely using polypropylene would likely improve recyclability and reduce cost but would also require addressing several very challenging technical issues To further improve their DFE process Herman Miller began to use LCA software to monitor their DFE results and to guide further refinement of their products They next planned to integrate carbon footprint into their DFE tool The carbon footprint of product is the amount of greenhouse gas emissions caused by the product usually expressed in terms of the equivalent mass of C02 emitted The consideration of carbon footprint would further affect Herman Miller material choices For example based only on recyclability and environmental toxicity aluminum is an environmentally friendly material However considering the carbon footprint of aluminum it may be less favorable choice compared to steel for example due to the amount of energy required to produce new aluminum Recycled aluminum however uses much less energy so this analysis also depends upon the sources of the materials and energy used to process the metals Design for Environment 247 Summary Every product has environmental impacts over its life cycle Design for environment DFE provides companies with practical method to minimize or eliminate these environmental impacts Effective DFE maintains or improves product quality and cost while reducing environ mental impacts DFE expands the traditional manufacturer focus to consider the full product life cycle and its relationship to the environment It begins with the extraction and processing of raw materials from natural resources followed by production distribution and use of the product Finally at the end of the product useful life are several recovery options remanufacturing or reuse of components recycling of materials or disposal through incineration or deposition in landfill to reintegrate the product into closedloop cycle DFE may involve activities throughout the product development process and requires an interdisciplinary approach Industrial design engineering purchasing and marketing all work together in the development of environmentally friendly products The DFE process consists of seven steps Product development teams will likely repeat some steps several times Set the DFE agenda drivers goals and team Identify potential environmental impacts Select DFE guidelines Apply the DFE guidelines to the initial product design Assess the environmental impacts Refine the product design to reduce or eliminate the environmental impacts sgwewwe Reflect on the DFE process and results

Environmental Management Life Cycle Assessment Princzples and Framework European Committee for Standardization Brussels 2006 List at least 10 types of environmental impacts over the life cycle of your personal computer or mobile phone Chart these as in Exhibit 12 representing your judgment of the relative impact of each life cycle stage Disassemble simple product such as ballpoint pen Suggest two ways to reduce its environmental impacts For the product considered in Exercise compute its environmental impact score using any LCA analysis tool available to you Design for Environment 249 Thought Questions What are some of the ways in which you have become more aware of your own environmental impact in recent years For the Setu chair what types of environmental impacts would be in the use stage of its life cycle In what ways can DFE help to improve the quality of product in terms of its func tionality reliability durability and reparability For each life cycle stage identify product or service that has high environmental im pacts during the particular life cycle stage Then suggest new or existing product or service that provides the same functionality with lower or without any environmental impacts How would you explicitly include renewable and nonrenewable energy in the life cycle diagram in Exhibit 12 Draw such diagram and explain it Explain the relationship between DFE and DFM Consider for example those DFE guidelines related to production in Exhibit 12 Consider the DFE assessment tool used by Herman Miller Exhibit 12 12 which computed the weighted sum of scores for material chemistry use of recycled content ease of disassembly and recyclability What modifications would you propose to cre ate DFE assessment tool for different type of product such as an automobile or mobile phone 250 Chapter 12 Appendix Design for Environment Guidelines Telenko et al 2008 compiled an extensive list of DFE guidelines based on number of sources covering range of industries Each life cycle stage has its own DFE guidelines that provide product development teams with suggestions to reduce environmental impacts The list below is based upon the compilation by Telenko et al Life Cycle Stage Materials Ensure Sustainability of Resources 99 89 Specify renewable and abundant resources Specify recyclable or recycled materials especially those within the company or for which market exists or needs to be stimulated Layer recycled and virgin material where virgin material is necessary Exploit unique properties of recycled materials Employ common and remanufactured components across models Specify mutually compatible materials and fasteners for recycling Specify one type of material for the product and its subassemblies Specify noncomposite nonblended materials and no alloys Specify renewable forms of energy Ensure Healthy Inputs and Outputs 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 Install protection against release of pollutants and hazardous substances Specify nonhazardous and otherwise environmentally clean substances especially in regards to user health Ensure that wastes are water based or biodegradable Specify the cleanest source of energy Include labels and instructions for safe handling of toxic materials Specify clean production processes for the product and in selection of components Concentrate toxic elements for easy removal and treatment Life Cycle Stage Production Ensure Minimal Use of Resources in Production 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 Apply structural techniques and materials to minimize the total volume of material Specify materials that do not require additional surface treatment coatings or inks Structure the product to avoid rejects and minimize material waste in production Minimize the number of components Specify materials with low intensity production and agriculture Specify clean high efficiency production processes Employ as few manufacturing steps as possible Design for Environment 251 Life Cycle Phase Distribution Ensure Minimal Use of Resources in Distribution 24 Replace the functions and appeals of packaging through the product design 25 Employ folding nesting or disassembly to distribute products in compact state 26 Specify lightweight materials and components Life Cycle Stage Use Ensure Efficiency of Resources During Product Use 27 Implement reusable supplies for ensuring the maximum usefulness of consumables 28 Implement fail safes against heat and material loss 29 Minimize the volume and weight of parts and materials to which energy is transferred 30 Specify best in class energy efficient components 31 Implement default power down for subsystems that are not in use 32 Ensure rapid warm up and power down 33 Maximize system efficiency for an entire range of usage conditions 34 Interconnect available flows of energy and materials within the product and between the product and its environment 35 Incorporate partial operation and permit users to turn off systems partially or completely 36 Use feedback mechanisms to indicate how much energy or water is being consumed 37 Incorporate intuitive controls for resource saving features 38 Incorporate features that prevent waste of materials by the user 39 Use default mechanisms to automatically reset the product to its most efficient setting EnsureAppropriate Durability of the Product and Components 40 Reutilize high embedded energy components 41 Plan for ongoing efficiency improvements 42 Improve aesthetics and functionality to ensure the aesthetic life is equal to the technical life 43 Ensure minimal maintenance and minimize failure modes in the product and its components 44 Specify better materials surface treatments or structural arrangements to protect products from dirt corrosion and wear 45 Indicate on the product which parts are to be cleaned maintained in specific way 46 Make wear detectable 47 Allow easy repair and upgrading especially for components that experience rapid change 48 Require few service and inspection tools 49 Facilitate testing of components 50 Allow for repetitive disassembly and reassembly 252 Chapter 12 Life Cycle Stage Recovery Enable Disassembly Separation and Purification of Materials and Components 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 Indicate on the product how it should be opened and make access points obvious Ensure that joints and fasteners are easily accessible Maintain stability and part placement during disassembly Minimize the number and variety of joining elements Ensure that destructive disassembly techniques do not harm people or reusable components Ensure that reusable parts can be cleaned easily and without damage Ensure that incompatible materials are easily separated Make component interfaces simple and reversibly separable Organize product or system into hierarchical modules by aesthetic repair and endof life protocol Implement reusable swappable platforms modules and components Condense into minimal number of parts Specify compatible adhesives labels surface coatings pigments and the like that do not interfere with cleaning Employ one disassembly direction without reorientation Specify all joints so that they are separable by hand or only few simple tools Minimize the number and length of operations for detachment Mark materials in molds with types and reutilization protocols Use shallow or open structure for easy access to subassemblies CHAPTER THIRTEEN Design for Manufacturing Courtesy of General Motors Corp EXHIBIT The General Motors liter V6 engine
