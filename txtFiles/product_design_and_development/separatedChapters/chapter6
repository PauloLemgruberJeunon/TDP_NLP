Specialized Bicycle Components was interested in developing new front suspension fork for the mountain bike market Although the firm was already selling suspension forks on its bicycles Exhibit it was interested in exploring designs that would provide higher value for the recreational cyclist The development team had spent great deal of time identifying customer needs In addition to logging many hours of riding on suspended bikes themselves the members of the team had interviewed lead users at mountain bike races and recreational cyclists on local trails and they also had spent time working with dealers in their stores As result of this process they had assembled list of customer needs They now faced several challenges How could the relatively subjective customer needs be translated into precise targets for the remaining development effort How could the team and its senior management agree on what would constitute success or failure of the resulting product design How could the team develop confidence that its intended product would garner substantial share of the suspension fork market How could the team resolve the inevitable trade offs among product characteristics like cost and weight This chapter presents method for establishing product specifications We assume that the customer needs are already documented as described in Chapter Identifying Customer Needs The method employs several simple information systems all of which can be constructed using conventional spreadsheet software What Are Specifications Customer needs are generally expressed in the language of the customer The primary customer needs for the suspension fork are listed in Exhibit Customer needs such as the suspension is easy to install or the suspension enables high speed descents on bumpy trails are typical in terms of the subjective quality of the expressions However while such expressions are helpful in developing clear sense of the issues of interest to customers they provide little specific guidance about how to design and engineer the product They simply leave too much margin for subjective interpretation For this reason development teams usually establish set of specifications which spell out in precise measurable detail what the product has to do Product specifications do not tell the team how to address the customer needs but they do represent an unambiguous agreement on what the team will attempt to achieve in order to satisfy the customer needs For example in contrast to the customer need that the suspension is easy to install the corresponding specification might be that the average time to assemble the fork to the frame is less than 75 seconds We intend the term product Specifications to mean the precise description of what the product has to do Some firms use the terms product requirements or engineering characteristics in this way Other firms use specifications or technical specifications to refer to key design variables of the product such as the oil viscosity or spring constant of the suspension system These are just differences in terminology For clarity let us beEXHIBIT Customer needs for the suspension fork and their relative importance shown in convenient spreadsheet format Product Specifications 93 No Need Imp we suspension reduces vibration to the hands we suspension allows easy traversal of slow difficult terrain we suspension enables

is the value of this metric Note that the value may take on several forms including particular number range or an inequality Values are always labeled with the appropriate units seconds kilograms joules Together the metric and value form specification The product Specifications plural are simply the set of the individual specifications When Are Specifications Established In an ideal world the team would establish the product specifications once early in the development process and then proceed to design and engineer the product to exactly meet those specifications For some products such as soap or soup this approach works quite well the technologists on the team can reliably concoct formulation that satisfies almost any reasonable specifications However for technology intensive products this is rarely possible For such products specifications are established at least twice Immediately after identifying the customer needs the team sets target Specifications These specifications represent the hopes and aspirations of the team but they are established before the team knows what constraints the product technology will place on what94 Chapter Mission Development Statement Identify Establish Generate Select Test Plan Plan Customer Target Product Product Product Final Downstream Needs Specifications Concepts Concept Concept Specifications Development Perform Economic Analysis Benchmark Competitive Products Build andTest Models and Prototypes EXHIBIT The concept development process The target specifications are set early in the process but setting the final specifications must wait until after the product concept has been selected can be achieved The team efforts may fail to meet some of these specifications and may exceed others depending on the product concept the team eventually selects For this reason the target specifications must be refined after product concept has been selected The team revisits the specifications while assessing the actual technological constraints and the expected production costs To set the final Specifications the team must frequently make hard trade offs among different desirable characteristics of the product For simplicity we present two stage process for establishing specifications but we note that in some organizations specifications are revisited many times throughout the development process The two stages in which specifications are established are shown as part of the concept development process in Exhibit Note that the final specifications are one of the key elements of the development plan which is usually documented in the project contract book The contract book described in Chapter 18 Managing Projects specifies what the team agrees to achieve the project schedule the required resources and the economic implications for the business The list of product specifications is also one of the key information systems used by the team throughout the development process This chapter presents two methods the first is for establishing the target specifications and the second is for setting the final specifications after the product concept has been selected Establishing Target Specifications As Exhibit illustrates the target specifications are established after the customer needs have been identified but before product concepts have been generated and the most promising one selected An arbitrary setting of the specifications may not be technically feasible For example in designing suspension fork the team cannot assume in advance that it will be able to achieve simultaneously mass of kilogram manufacturing cost of 30 and the best descent time on the test track as these are three quite aggressive specifications Actually meeting the specifications established at this point is contingent upon the details of the product concept the team eventually selects For this reason such preliminary specifications are labeled target specifications They are the goals of the development team describing product that the team believes would succeed in the marketplace Later these specifications will be refined based on the limitations of the product concept actually selected Product Specifications 95 The process of establishing the target specifications contains four steps Prepare the list of metrics Collect competitive benchmarking information Set ideal and marginally acceptable target values bP Nt Reflect on the results and the process Step Prepare the List of Metrics The most useful metrics are those that reflect as directly as possible the degree to which the product satisfies the customer needs The relationship between needs and metrics is central to the entire concept of specifications The working assmnption is that translation from customer needs to set of precise measurable specifications is possible and that meeting specifications will therefore lead to satisfaction of the associated customer needs list of metrics is shown in Exhibit good way to generate the list of metrics is to contemplate each need in turn and to consider what precise measurable characteristic of the product will reflect the degree to which the product satisfies that need In the ideal case there is one and only one metric for each need In practice this is frequently not possible For example consider the need that the suspension be easy to install The team may conclude that this need is largely captured by measuring the time required for assembly of the fork to the frame However note the possible subtleties in this translation Is assembly time really identical to ease of installation The installation could be extremely fast but require an awkward and painful set of finger actions which ultimately may lead to worker injury or dealer frustration Because of the imprecise nature of the translation process those establishing the specifications should have been directly involved in identifying the customer needs In this way the team can rely on its understanding of the meaning of each need statement derived from firsthand interactions with customers The need for the fork to reduce vibration to the user hands may be even more difficult to translate into single metric because there are many different conditions under which vibration can be transmitted including small bumps on level roads and big bumps on rough trails The team may conclude that several metrics are required to capture this need including for example the metrics attenuation from dropout to handlebar at 10 Hz and maximum value from the Monster The Monster is suspension test developed by Mountain Bike magazine simple needs metrics matrix represents the relationship between needs and metrics An example needs metrics matrix is shown in Exhibit The rows of the matrix correspond to the customer needs and the columns of the matrix correspond to the metrics mark in cell of the matrix means that the need and the metric associated with the cell are related performance relative to the metric will influence the degree to which the product satisfies the customer need This matrix is key element of the House of Quality graphical technique used in Quality Function Deployment or QFD Hauser and Clausing 1988 In many cases we find the information in the needs metrics matrix is just as easily communicated by listing the numbers of the needs related to each metric alongside the list of metrics the second column in Exhibit There are some cases however in which the mapping from needs to metrics is complex and the matrix can be quite useful for representing this mapping 96 Chapter Metric No Need Nos Metric Imp Units Attenuation from dropout to handlebar at 10 Hz dB Spring preload Maximum value from the Monster Minimum descent time on test track Damping

suspension The relative importance of each metric and the units for the metric are also shown Subj is an abbreviation indicating that metric is subjective few guidelines should be considered when constructing the list of metrics Metrics should be complete Ideally each customer need would correspond to single metric and the value of that metric would correlate perfectly with satisfaction of that need In practice several metrics may be necessary to completely reflect single customer need Metrics should be dependent not independent variables This guideline is variant of the what not how principle introduced in Chapter As do customer needs specifications also indicate what the product must do but not how theProduct Specifications 97 fl L0 CO fl L0 CO fl L0 FFFFFFFFF NNNNNNN r5 r5 Q0

EXHIBIT The needs metrics matrix specifications will be achieved Designers use many types of variables in product development some are dependent such as the mass of the fork and some are independent such as the material used for the fork In other words designers cannot control mass directly because it arises from other independent decisions the designers will make such as dimensions and materials choices Metrics specify the overall performance of product and should therefore be the dependent variables the performance measures or output variables in the design problem By using dependent variables for the specifications designers are left with the freedom to achieve the specifications using the best approach possible 98 Chapter Metrics should be practical It does not serve the team to devise metric for bicycle suspension that can only be measured by scientific laboratory at cost of 100 000 Ideally metrics will be directly observable or analyzable properties of the product that can be easily evaluated by the team Some needs cannot easily be translated into quantifiable metrics The need that the suspension instills pride may be quite critical to success in the fashion conscious mountain bike market but how can pride be quantified In these cases the team simply repeats the need statement as specification and notes that the metric is subjective and would be evaluated by panel of customers We indicate this by entering Subj in the units column The metrics should include the popular criteria for comparison in the marketplace Many customers in various markets buy products based on independently published evaluations Such evaluations are found for example in Popular Science Consumer Reports on various Internet sites or in our case in Bicycling and Mountain Bike magazines If the team knows that its product will be evaluated by the trade media and knows what the evaluation criteria will be then it should include metrics corresponding to these criteria Mountain Bike magazine uses test machine called the Monster which measures the vertical acceleration in of the handlebars as bicycle equipped with the fork runs over block 50 millimeters tall For this reason the team included maximum value from the Monster as metric If the team cannot find relationship between the criteria used by the media and the customer needs it has identified then it should ensure that need has not been overlooked and or should work with the media to revise the criteria In few cases the team may conclude that high performance in the media evaluations is in itself customer need and choose to include metric used by the media that has little intrinsic technical merit In addition to denoting the needs related to each metric Exhibit contains the units of measurement and an importance rating for each metric The units of measurement are most commonly conventional engineering units such as kilograms and seconds However some metrics will not lend themselves to numerical values The need that the suspension works with fenders is best translated into specification listing the models of fenders with which the fork is compatible In this case the value of the metric is actually list of fenders rather than number For the metric involving the standard safety test the value is pass fail We indicate these two cases by entering List and Binary in the units column The importance rating of metric is derived from the importance ratings of the needs it reflects For cases in which metric maps directly to single need the importance rating of the need becomes the importance rating of the metric For cases in which metric is related to more than one need the importance of the metric is determined by considering the importances of the needs to which it relates and the nature of these relationships We believe that there are enough subtleties in this process that importance weightings can best be determined through discussion among the team members rather than through formal algorithm When there are relatively few specifications and establishing the relative importance of these specifications is critically important conjoint analysis may be useful Conjoint analysis is described briefly later in this chapter and publications explaining the technique are referenced at the end of the chapter Product Specifications 99 Step Collect Competitive Benchmarking Information Unless the team expects to enjoy total monopoly the relationship of the new product to competitive products is paramount in determining commercial success While the team will have entered the product development process with some idea of how it wishes to compete in the marketplace the target specifications are the language the team uses to discuss and agree on the detailed positioning of its product relative to existing products both its own and competitors Information on competing products must be gathered to support these positioning decisions An example of competitive benchmarking chart is shown in Exhibit The columns of the chart correspond to the competitive products and the rows are the metrics established in step Note that the competitive benchmarking chart can be constructed as simple appendage to the spreadsheet containing the list of metrics This information is one of the rooms in the House of Quality described by Hauser and Clausing The benchmarking chart is conceptually very simple For each competitive product the values of the metrics are simply entered down column Gathering these data can be very time consuming involving at the least purchasing testing disassembling and estimating the production costs of the most important competitive products However this investment of time is essential as no product development team can expect to succeed without having this type of information word of warning Sometimes the data contained in competitors catalogs and supporting literature are not accurate Where possible values of the key metrics should be verified by independent testing or observation An alternative competitive benchmarking chart can be constructed with rows corresponding to the customer needs and columns corresponding to the competitive products see Exhibit This chart is used to compare customers perceptions of the relative degree to which the products satisfy their needs Constructing this chart requires collecting customer perception data which can also be very expensive and time consuming Some techniques for measuring customers perceptions of satisfaction of needs are contained in book by Urban and Hauser 1993 Both charts can be useful and any discrepancies between the two are instructive At minimum chart showing the competitive values of the metrics Exhibit should be created Step Set Ideal and Marginally Acceptable Target Values In this step the team synthesizes the available information in order to actually set the target values for the metrics Two types of target value are useful an ideal value and marginally acceptable value The ideal value is the best result the team could hope for The marginally acceptable value is the value of the metric that would just barely make the product commercially viable Both of these targets are useful in guiding the subsequent stages of concept generation and concept selection and for refining the specifications after the product concept has been selected There are five ways to express the values of the metrics At least These specifications establish targets for the lower bound on metric but higher is still better For example the value of the brake mounting stiffness is specified to be at least 325 kilonewtons meter At most These specifications establish targets for the upper bound on metric with smaller values being better For example the value for the mass of the suspension fork is set to be at most kilograms 100 Chapter Rox Rox Gunhill Metric Need ST Maniray Tahx Tahx Tonka Head

chart based on metrics Between and These specifications establish both upper and lower bounds for the value of metric For example the value for the spring preload is set to be between 480 and 800 newtons Any more and the suspension is harsh any less and the suspension is too bouncy Exactly These specifications establish target of particular value of metric with any deviation degrading performance For example the ideal value for the rake offset metric is set to 38 millimeters This type of specification is to be avoided if possible because such specifications substantially constrain the design Often upon reconsideration the team realizes that what initially appears as an exactly specification can be expressed as between and specification set of discrete values Some metrics will have values corresponding to several discrete choices For example the headset diameters are 000 125 or 250 inches Industry practice is to use English units for these and several other critical bicycle

range of values for one metric may depend on another In other words we may wish to express target as for example the fork tip lateral stiffness is no more than 20 percent of the lateral stiffness at the brake pivots In applications where the team feels this level of complexity is warranted such targets can easily be included although we recommend that this level of complexity not be introduced until the final phase of the specifications process Using these five different types of expressions for values of the metrics the team sets the target specifications The team simply proceeds down the list of metrics and assigns both the marginally acceptable and ideal target values for each metric These decisions are facilitated by the metric based competitive benchmarking chart shown in Exhibit To set the target values the team has many considerations including the capability of competing products available at the time competitors future product capabilities if these are predictable and the product mission statement and target market segment Exhibit shows the targets assigned for the suspension fork 102 Chapter ST Maniray Rox Tahx Rox Tahx Tonka Gunhill No Need Imp Tritrack Quadra Ti 21

perceived satisfaction of the need Product Specifications 03 Because most of the values are expressed in terms of bounds upper or lower or both the team is establishing the boundaries of the competitively viable product space The team hopes that the product will meet some of the ideal targets but is confident that product can be commercially viable even if it exhibits one or more marginally acceptable characteristics Note that these specifications are preliminary because until product concept is chosen and some of the design details are worked out many of the exact trade offs are uncertain Step Reflect on the Results and the Process The team may require some iteration to agree on the targets Reflection after each iteration helps to ensure that the results are consistent with the goals of the project Questions to consider include Are members of the team gaming For example is the key marketing representative insisting that an aggressive value is required for particular metric in the hopes that by setting high goal the team will actually achieve more than if his or her true and more lenient beliefs were expressed Should the team consider offering multiple products or at least multiple options for the product in order to best match the particular needs of more than one market segment or will one average product suffice Are any specifications missing Do the specifications reflect the characteristics that will dictate commercial success Once the targets have been set the team can proceed to generate solution concepts The target specifications then can be used to help the team select concept and will help the team know when concept is commercially viable See Chapter Concept Generation and Chapter Concept Selection Setting the Final Specifications As the team finalizes the choice of concept and prepares for subsequent design and development the specifications are revisited Specifications that originally were only targets expressed as broad ranges of values are now refined and made more precise Finalizing the specifications is difficult because of trade offs inverse relationships between two specifications that are inherent in the selected product concept Trade offs frequently occur between different technical performance metrics and almost always occur between technical performance metrics and cost For example one trade off is between brake mounting stiffness and mass of the fork Because of the basic mechanics of the fork structure these specifications are inversely related assuming other factors are held constant Another trade off is between cost and mass For given concept the team may be able to reduce the mass of the fork by making some parts out of titanium instead of steel Unfortunately decreasing the mass in this way will most likely increase the manufacturing cost of the product The difficult part of refining the specifications is choosing how such trade offs will be resolved 104 Chapter Metric Need Marginal Ideal No

specifications Like the other information systems this one is easily encoded with spreadsheet as simple extension to the list of specifications Product Specifications 05 Here we propose five step process Develop technical models of the product Develop cost model of the product Refine the specifications making trade offs where necessary Flow down the specifications as appropriate 59P Reflect on the results and the process Step Develop Technical Models of the Product technical model of the product is tool for predicting the values of the metrics for particular set of design decisions We intend the term models to refer to both analytical and physical approximations of the product See Chapter 14 Prototyping for further discussion of such models At this point the team had chosen an oil damped coil spring concept for the suspension fork The design decisions facing the team included details such as the materials for the structural components the orifice diameter and oil viscosity for the damper and the spring constant Three models linking such design decisions to the performance metrics are shown in conceptual form in Exhibit Such models can be used to predict the product performance along number of dimensions The inputs to these models are the independent design variables associated with the product concept such as oil viscosity orifice diameter spring constant and geometry The outputs of the model are the values of the metrics such as attenuation stiffness and fatigue life Ideally the team will be able to accurately model the product analytically perhaps by implementing the model equations in spreadsheet or computer simulation Such model allows the team to predict rapidly what type of performance can be expected from particular choice of design variables without costly physical experimentation In most cases such analytical models will be available for only small subset of the metrics For example the team was able to model attenuation analytically based on the engineers knowledge of dynamic systems Several independent models each corresponding to subset of the metrics may be more manageable than one large integrated model For example the team developed separate analytical model for the brake mounting stiffness that was completely independent of the dynamic model used to predict vibration attenuation In some cases no analytical models will be available at all For example the team was not able to model analytically the fatigue performance of the suspension so physical models were built and tested It is generally necessary to actually build variety of different physical mock ups or prototypes in order to explore the implications of several combinations of design variables To reduce the number of models that must be constructed it is useful to employ design of experiments DOE techniques which can minimize the number of experiments required to explore the design space See Chapter 15 Robust Design for summary of DOE methods Armed with these technical models the team can predict whether any particular set of specifications such as the ideal target values is technically feasible by exploring different combinations of design variables This type of modeling and analysis prevents the team from setting combination of specifications that cannot be achieved using the available latitude in the product concept 106 Chapter

Suspension Durability CVCIGS to Failure Physical Design Variables Model Inputs Metrics Model Outputs EXHIBIT Models used to assess technical feasibility Technical models may be analytical or physical approximations of the product concept Note that technical model is almost always unique to particular product concept One of the models illustrated in Exhibit is for an oil damped suspension system the model would be substantially different if the team had selected concept employing rubber suspension element Thus the modeling step can only be performed after the concept has been chosen Step Develop Cost Model of the Product The goal of this step of the process is to make sure that the product can be produced at the target cost The target cost is the manufacturing cost at which the company and its distribution partners can make adequate profits while still offering the product to the end customer at competitive price The appendix to this chapter provides an explanation of target costing It is at this point that the team attempts to discover for example how much it will have to sacrifice in manufacturing cost to save 50 grams of mass For most products the first estimates of manufacturing costs are completed by drafting bill of materials list of all the parts and estimating purchase price or fabrication cost for each part At this point in the development process the team does not generally know all of the components that will be in the product but the team nevertheless makes an attempt to list the components it expects will be required While early estimates generally focus on the cost of components the team will usually make rough estimate of assembly and other manufacturing costs overhead at this point as well Efforts to develop these early cost estimates involve soliciting cost estimates from vendors and estimating the production costs of the components the firm will make itself This processProduct Specifications 07 Qty High Low High Total Low Total Component

estimates to facilitate realistic trade offs in the product specifications is often facilitated by purchasing expert and production engineer bill of materials cost model is shown in Exhibit 10 for the suspension fork See Chapter 13 Design for Manufacturing for more details on estimating manufacturing cost useful way to record cost information is to list figures for the high and low estimates of each item This helps the team to understand the range of uncertainty in the estimates The bill of materials is typically used iteratively the team performs what if cost analysis for set of design decisions and then revises these decisions based on what it learns The bill of materials is itself kind of performance model but instead of predicting the value of technical performance metric it predicts cost performance The bill of materials remains useful throughout the development process and is updated regularly as frequently as once each week to reflect the current status of the estimated manufacturing cost At this point in the development process teams developing complex products containing hundreds or thousands of parts will not generally be able to include every part in the bill of materials Instead the team will list the major components and subsystems and place bounds on their costs based on past experience or on the judgment of suppliers 108 Chapter 120 110 100 80 70 Estimated Manufacturing Cost 60 50 Ideal Values Step Refine the Specifications Making Trade Offs Where Necessary Once the team has constructed technical performance models where possible and constructed preliminary cost model these tools can be used to develop final specifications Finalizing specifications can be accomplished in group session in which feasible combinations of values are determined through the use of the technical models and then the cost implications are explored In an iterative fashion the team converges on the specifications that will most favorably position the product relative to the competition will best satisfy the customer needs and will ensure adequate profits One important tool for supporting this decision making process is the competitive map An example competitive map is shown in Exhibit 11 This map is simply scatter plot of the competitive products along two dimensions selected from the set of metrics and is sometimes called trade off map The map displayed in Exhibit 11 shows estimated manufacturing cost versus score on the Monster test The regions defined by the marginal and ideal values of the specifications are shown on the map This map is particularly useful in showing that all of the high performance suspensions low Monster scores have high estimated manufacturing costs Armed with technical performance models and cost model the team can assess whether or not it will be able to beat the trade off exhibited in the competitive map RoxTathi 21 Maniray OGunhiII Head Shox RoxTahx Ouadra MarginalValues Tonka Pro STTritrack Trade

concepts are also drawn on this map Product Specifications 09 These maps can be constructed directly from the data contained in the competitive benchmarking chart using the plotting feature of the spreadsheet software Generally the team will prepare three or four such maps corresponding to handful of critical metrics Additional maps may be created as needed to support subsequent decision making The competitive map is used to position the new product relative to the competition Trade off curves showing performance of the product concept for range of design variables can be drawn directly on the competitive map as shown in Exhibit 11 Using the technical and cost models of the product and the competitive maps the team can refine the specifications in order to both satisfy the inherent constraints of the product concept and make the trade offs in way that will provide performance advantage relative to the competitive products The final specifications for the suspension fork are shown in Exhibit 12 For relatively mature product categories in which competition is based on performance relative to handful of well understood performance metrics conjoint analysis may be useful in refining product specifications Conjoint analysis uses customer survey data to construct model of customer preference Essentially each respondent in sample of potential customers is repeatedly asked to evaluate hypothetical products characterized by set of attributes These attributes must generally be metrics that are easily understood by customers fuel economy and price for automobiles Subjective attributes styling can be represented graphically The hypothetical products are constructed using the statistical techniques of experimental design Using customer responses conjoint analysis infers the relative importance of each attribute to the customer These data can then be used to predict which product customer would choose when offered hypothetical set of alternatives By using these predictions for all of the customers in sample the market share of each product in the set of alternatives can be forecast Using this approach the specification values that maximize market share can be estimated The details of conjoint analysis are fairly straightforward but beyond the scope of this chapter Relevant references are listed at the end of the chapter Step Flow Down the Specifications as Appropriate This chapter focuses on the specifications for relatively simple component designed by single relatively small development team Establishing specifications takes on additional importance and is substantially more challenging when developing highly complex product consisting of multiple subsystems designed by multiple development teams In such context specifications are used to define the development objectives of each of the subsystems as well as for the product as whole The challenge in this case is to flow down the overall specifications to specifications for each subsystem For example the overall specifications for an automobile contain metrics like fuel economy 100 kilometer hour acceleration time and turning radius However specifications must also be created for the several dozen major subsystems that make up the automobile including the body engine transmission braking system and suspension The specifications for the engine include metrics like peak power peak torque and fuel consumption at peak efficiency One challenge in the flow down process is to ensure that the subsystem specifications in fact reflect the overall product specifications that if specifications for the subsystems are achieved the overall product specifications will be achieved second challenge is to ensure that certain specifications for different subsystems are equally1 10 Chapter EXHIBIT The final specifications No Metric Unit Value Attenuation from dropout to handlebar at 10 Hz dB 12 Spring preload 600 650 Maximum value from the

Industrial Standards test Binary Pass 26 Bending strength frontal loading kN 10 difficult to meet That is for example that the mass specification for the engine is not inordinately more difficult to meet than is the mass specification for the body Otherwise the cost of the product will likely be higher than necessary Some overall component specifications can be established through budget allocations For example specifications for manufacturing cost mass and power consumption can be allocated to subsystems with the confidence that the overall cost mass and power consumption of the product will simply be the sum of these quantities for each subsystem Product Specifications To some extent geometric volume can be allocated this way as well Other component specifications must be established through more complex understanding of how subsystem performance relates to overall product performance For example fuel efficiency is relatively complex function of vehicle mass rolling resistance aerodynamic drag coefficient frontal area and engine efficiency Establishing specifications for the body tires and engine requires model of how these variables relate to overall fuel efficiency comprehensive treatment of flowing down specifications for complex products is beyond the scope of this chapter and in fact is major focus of the field of systems engineering We refer the reader to several useful books on this subject in the reference list Step Reflect on the Results and the Process As always the final step in the method is to reflect on the outcome and the process Some questions the team may want to consider are Is the product winner The product concept should allow the team to actually set the specifications so that the product will meet the customer needs and excel competitively If not then the team should return to the concept generation and selection phase or abandon the project How much uncertainty is there in the technical and cost models If competitive success is dictated by metrics around which much uncertainty remains the team may wish to refine the technical or cost models in order to increase confidence in meeting the specifications Is the concept chosen by the team best suited to the target market or could it be best applied in another market say the low end or high end instead of the middle The selected concept may actually be too good If the team has generated concept that is dramatically superior to the competitive products it may wish to consider employing the concept in more demanding and potentially more profitable market segment Should the firm initiate formal effort to develop better technical models of some aspect of the product performance for future use Sometimes the team will discover that it does not really understand the underlying product technology well enough to create useful performance models In such circumstances an engineering effort to develop better understanding and models may be useful in subsequent development pI OJCCtS Summary Customer needs are generally expressed in the language of the customer In order to provide specific guidance about how to design and engineer product development teams establish set of specifications which spell out in precise measurable detail what the product has to do to be commercially successful The specifications must reflect the customer needs differentiate the product from the competitive products and be technically and economically realizable Specifications are typically established at least twice Immediately after identifying the customer needs the team sets target specifications After concept selection and testing the team develops final specifications Chapter Target specifications represent the hopes and aspirations of the team but they are established before the team knows the constraints the product technology will place on what can be achieved The team efforts may fail to meet some of these specifications and may exceed others depending on the details of the product concept the team eventually selects The process of establishing the target specifications entails four steps Prepare the list of metrics Collect competitive benchmarking information Set ideal and marginally acceptable target values Reflect on the results and the process Final specifications are developed by assessing the actual technological constraints and the expected production costs using analytical and physical models During this refinement phase the team must make difficult trade offs among various desirable characteristics of the product The five step process for refining the specifications is Develop technical models of the product Develop cost model of the product Refine the specifications making trade offs where necessary Flow down the specifications as appropriate Reflect on the results and the process The specifications process is facilitated by several simple information systems that can easily be created using conventional spreadsheet software Tools such as the list of metrics the needs metrics matrix the competitive benchmarking charts and the competitive maps all support the team decision making by providing the team with way to represent and discuss the specifications Because of the need to utilize the best possible knowledge of the market the customers the core product technology and the cost implications of design alternatives the specifications process requires active participation from team members representing the marketing design and manufacturing functions of the enterprise

last many years Some of the same metrics seem to be involved in trade offs for many different products What are some examples of such metrics Thought Questions How might you establish precise and measurable specifications for intangible needs such as the front suspension looks great Why are some customer needs difficult to map to single metric How might you explain situation in which customers perceptions of the competitive products as in Exhibit are not consistent with the values of the metrics for those same products as in Exhibit Can poor performance relative to one specification always be compensated for by high performance on other specifications If so how can there ever really be marginally acceptable value for metric Why should independent design variables not be used as metrics 14 Chapter Appendix Target Costing Target costing is simple idea set the value of the manufacturing cost specification based on the price the company hopes the end user will pay for the product and on the profit margins that are required for each stage in the distribution channel For example assume Specialized wishes to sell its suspension fork to its customers through bicycle shops If the price it expected the customer to pay was 250 and if bicycle shops normally expect gross profit margin of 45 percent on components then Specialized would have to sell its fork to bicycle shops for 45 250 137 50 If Specialized wishes to earn gross margin of at least 40 percent on its components then its unit manufacturing cost must be less than 40 137 50 82 50 Target costing is the reverse of the cost plus approach to pricing The cost plus approach begins with what the firm expects its manufacturing costs to be and then sets its prices by adding its expected profit margin to the cost This approach ignores the realities of competitive markets in which prices are driven by market and customer factors Target costing is mechanism for ensuring that specifications are set in way that allows the product to be competitively priced in the marketplace Some products are sold directly by manufacturer to end users of the product Frequently products are distributed through one or more intermediate stages such as distributors and retailers Exhibit 13 provides some approximate values of gross profit margins for different product categories Let be the gross profit margin of stage in the distribution channel where is the price this stage charges its customers and is the cost this stage pays for the product it sells Note that mark up is similar to margin but is defined slightly differently as so that margin of 50 percent is equivalent to mark up of 100 percent Target cost is given by the following expression Mi izl where is the price paid by the end user is the number of stages in the distribution channel and is the margin of the ith stage EXAMPLE Assume the end user price equals 250 If the product is sold directly to the end user by the manufacturer and the desired gross profit margin of the manufacturer Mm equals 40 then the target cost is 250 40 150Product Specifications Manufacturers Automobiles Computers Appliances Consumer electronics Sporting goods
