composite General Motors Powertrain Division manufactures about 500 liter V6 engines every day Exhibit 13 Facing such high production volumes the company had strong interest in reducing the cost of the engine while simultaneously enhancing its quality team was formed to improve one of the most expensive subassemblies in the engine the air intake manifold The intake manifold primary function is to route air from the throttle to the intake valves at the cylinders The original and redesigned intake manifold assemblies are shown in Exhibit 13 This chapter presents method of design for manufacturing using the GM V6 intake manifold as an example Photos by Stuart CohenDesign for Manufacturing 255 Design for Manufacturing Defined Customer needs and product specifications are useful for guiding the concept phase of product development however during the later development activities teams often have difficulty linking needs and specifications to the specific design issues they face For this reason many teams practice design for DFX methodologies where may correspond to one of dozens of quality criteria such as reliability robustness serviceability environmental impact or manufacturability The most common of these methodologies is design for manufacturing DFM which is of universal importance because it directly addresses manufacturing costs This chapter is primarily about DFM but it is also intended to illustrate by example these general principles which apply to methodologies for achieving any of the Xs in DFX Detail design decisions can have substantial impact on product quality and cost Development teams face multiple and often conflicting goals It is important to have metrics with which to compare alternative designs Dramatic improvements often require substantial creative efforts early in the process well defined method assists the decision making process Manufacturing cost is key determinant of the economic success of product In simple terms economic success depends on the profit margin earned on each sale of the product and on how many units of the product the firm can sell Profit margin is the difference between the manufacturer selling price and the cost of making the product The number of units sold and the sales price are to large degree determined by the overall quality of the product Economically successful design is therefore about ensuring high product quality while minimizing manufacturing cost DFM is one method for achieving this goal effective DFM practice leads to low manufacturing costs without sacrificing product quality See Chapter 17 Product Development Economics for more detailed discussion of models relating manufacturing costs to economic success DFM Requires Cross Functional Team Design for manufacturing is one of the most integrative practices involved in product development DFM utilizes information of several types including sketches drawings product specifications and design alternatives detailed understanding of production and assembly processes and estimates of manufacturing costs production volumes and ramp up timing DFM therefore requires the contributions of most members of the development team as well as outside experts DFM efforts commonly draw upon expertise from manufacturing engineers cost accountants and production personnel in addition to product designers Many companies use structured team based workshops to facilitate the integration and sharing of views required for DFM DFM ls Performed throughout the Development Process DFM begins during the concept development phase when the product functions and specifications are being determined When choosing product concept cost is almost always one of the criteria on which the decision is made even though cost estimates at this phase are highly subjective and approximate When product specifications are256 Chapter 13 finalized the team makes trade offs between desired performance characteristics For example weight reduction may increase manufacturing costs At this point the team may have an approximate bill of materials list of parts with estimates of costs During the system level design phase of development the team makes decisions about how to break up the product into individual components based in large measure on the expected cost and manufacturing complexity implications Accurate cost estimates finally become available during the detail design phase of development when many more decisions are driven by manufacturing concerns Overview of the DFM Process Our DFM method is illustrated in Exhibit 13 It consists of five steps plus iteration Estimate the manufacturing costs Reduce the costs of components Reduce the costs of assembly Reduce the costs of supporting production 59P Consider the impact of DFM decisions on other factors As shown in Exhibit 13 the DFM method begins with the estimation of the manufacturing cost of the proposed design This helps the team to determine at general level which aspects of the design components assembly or support are most costly The team then directs its attention to the appropriate areas in the subsequent steps This process is iterative It is not unusual to recompute the manufacturing cost estimate and to improve the design of the product dozens of times before agreeing that it is good enough As long as the product design is improving these DFM iterations may continue even until pilot production begins At some point the design is frozen or released and any further modifications are considered formal engineering changes or become part of the next generation of the product In the next section we use the original GM V6 intake manifold as an example and explain how manufacturing costs are determined Then recognizing that accurate cost estimates are difficult if not impossible to obtain we present several useful methods for reducing the costs of components assembly and production support We use the redesigned intake manifold and other products as examples to illustrate these DFM principles Finally we discuss the results achieved through DFM and some of the broader implications of DFM decisions Step Estimate the Manufacturing Costs Exhibit 13 shows simple input output model of manufacturing system The inputs include raw materials purchased components employees efforts energy and equipment The outputs include finished goods and waste Manufacturing cost is the sum of all of the expenditures for the inputs of the system and for disposal of the wastes produced by the system As the metric of cost for product firms generally use unit manufacturing cost which is computed by dividing the total manufacturing costs for some period usually quarter or year by the number of units of the product manufactured during that period This simple concept is complicated in practice by several issues EXHIBIT The design for manufacturing DFM method Design for Manufacturing 257 Proposed Design Estimate the Manufacturing Costs Reduce the Costs of Supporting Production Reduce the Costs of Assembly Reduce the Costs of Components Consider the Impact of DFM Decisions on Other Factors Recompute the Manufacturing Costs Good Enough Acceptable Design What are the boundaries of the manufacturing system Should the field service operations be included What about product development activities How do we charge the product for the use of expensive general purpose equipment that lasts for many years How are costs allocated among more than one product line in large multiproduct manufacturing systems These are issues around which much of the field of managerial accounting is built and we do not treat them in depth here Nevertheless we will be mindful of these complications as we discuss cost and DFM in this chapter 258 Chapter 13 EXHIBIT simple input output model of manufacturing system Equipment Information Tooling ill Labor MANUFACTURING SYSTEM Finished Goods Raw Materials Purchased Components Energy Supplies Services Waste Exhibit 13 shows one way of categorizing the elements of manufacturing cost Under this scheme the unit manufacturing cost of product consists of costs in three categories Component costs The components of product also simply called parts of the product may include standard parts purchased from suppliers Examples of standard components include motors switches electronic chips and screws Other components are custom parts made according to the manufacturer design from raw materials such as sheet steel plastic pellets or aluminum bars Some custom components are made in the manufacturer own plant while others may be produced by suppliers according to the manufacturer design specifications Assembly costs Discrete goods are generally assembled from parts The process of assembling almost always incurs labor costs and may also incur costs for equipment and tooling Manufacturing Cost Components Assembly Overhead Standard Equipment Indirect Custom Labor andTooIing Support Allocation Raw Material Processing Tooling EXHIBIT Elements of the manufacturing cost of product Design for Manufacturing 259 Overhead costs Overhead is the category used to encompass all of the other costs We find it useful to distinguish between two types of overhead support costs and other indirect allocations Support costs are the costs associated with materials handling quality assurance purchasing shipping receiving facilities and equipment tooling maintenance among others These are the support systems required to manufacture the product and these costs do greatly depend upon the product design Nevertheless because these costs are often shared by more than one product line they are lumped together in the category of overhead Indirect allocations are the costs of manufacturing that cannot be directly linked to particular product but that must be paid for to be in business For example the salary of the security guard and the cost of maintenance to the building and grounds are indirect costs because these activities are shared among several different products and are difficult to allocate directly to specific product Because indirect costs are not specifically linked to the design of the product they are not relevant to DFM even though they do contribute to the cost of the product Transportation Costs The model of manufacturing cost in Exhibit 13 does not include any costs for transporting finished goods through the distribution system Manufacturing often occurs at location great distance from the eventual customer Although the DFM method presented here does not explicitly include transportation expense estimating those costs is relatively easy For instance most goods are transported overseas using standard shipping containers which hold about 70 cubic meters of cargo In most cases these containers are shipped from one location to another at fixed cost Currently the cost of shipping container between Asia and the United States is roughly 000 USD resulting in shipping cost rate of 86 USD m3 Rates for air freight and trucking although based on combination of weight and volume are also readily available Based on these rates the product design team can easily include transportation costs in its analysis and doing so may be warranted when the team faces design decisions involving the physical volume or weight of the product Fixed Costs versus Variable Costs Another way to divide manufacturing costs is between fixed costs and variable costs Fixed costs are those that are incurred in predetermined amount regardless of how many units of the product are manufactured Purchasing the injection mold required for the new intake manifold is an example of fixed cost Whether 000 or million units are produced the fixed cost of the mold is incurred and does not change Another example is the cost of setting up the factory work area for the intake manifold assembly line This cost is also fixed regardless of how many units are produced Despite the terminology however no cost is truly fixed If we quadruple the production quantity we may have to build another production line Conversely we may be able to consolidate two assembly cells if we cannot use all the capacity due to dramatically lower production quantities When considering cost as fixed ranges of production quantities and the assumed time horizon should be specified Variable costs are those incurred in direct proportion to the number of units produced For example the cost of raw materials is directly proportional to how many intake260 Chapter 13 manifolds are produced and therefore to how many liter V6 engines are made Assembly labor is sometimes considered variable cost as well because many firms can adjust the staffing of assembly operations by shifting workers to other areas on short notice The Bill of Materials Because manufacturing cost estimation is fundamental to DFM it is useful to keep this information well organized Exhibit 13 shows an information system for recording manufacturing cost estimates It basically consists of bill of materials BOM augmented with cost information The BOM usually pronounced bomb is list of each individual component in the product Frequently the BOM is created using an indented format in which the assembly tree structure is illustrated by the indentation of components and subassembly names The columns of the BOM show the cost estimates broken down into fixed and variable costs The variable costs may include materials machine time and labor Fixed costs consist of tooling and other nonrecurring expenses NRE such as specialized equipment and one time setup costs The tooling lifetime is used to compute the unit fixed cost unless the tool expected lifetime exceeds the product lifetime volume in which case the lower product volume is used To compute total cost overhead is added according to the firm accepted cost accounting scheme Note that additional fixed costs such as depreciation of capital equipment used for several products are often also included in the overhead charge Processing Total Unit Tooling Tooling Total Unit Purchased Machine Assembly Variable and Other Lifetime Fixed Total Component Materials Labor Labor Cost NRE units Cost Cost Manifold machined casting 12 83 23 18 06 1960 500 50 18 56 EGR return pipe

components The EGR exhaust gas recirculation PCV positive crankcase ventilation and vacuum block components are included here to facilitate comparison with the redesigned manifold assembly Design for Manufacturing 261 Estimating the Costs of Standard Components The costs of standard components are estimated by either comparing each part to substantially similar part the firm is already producing or purchasing in comparable volumes or soliciting price quotes from vendors or suppliers The costs of minor components bolts springs and inserts are usually obtained from the firm experience with similar components while the costs of maj or components are usually obtained from vendor quotes In obtaining price quotes the estimated production quantities are extremely important For example the unit price on purchase of dozen screws or inserts may be 10 times higher than the unit prices paid by GM when purchasing 100 000 of these parts every month If the anticipated production quantities are high enough an application engineer or sales engineer is usually quite willing to work with the development team to specify component properly For internally fabricated standard components if the required quantities are high there may not be available production capacity necessitating the purchase of additional equipment or the use of outside suppliers Some suppliers will design and fabricate custom variation to standard component if production quantities are high enough For example small electric motors such as those found in powered hand tools are often designed and built specifically for the product application If the production quantities are high enough say 100 000 per year in this case these custom motors are quite economical to per unit depending on the performance characteristics For the intake manifold the volumes are sufficiently high that custom studs bushings and other parts may not cost much more than standard components However as we discuss later introducing new parts can add substantial cost and complexity to the production system and field service operations which increases the support costs Vendors for most standard components can be found in the Thomas Register of American Manufacturers or by looking for company names on components used in related products To obtain price quote first request catalog or product literature now generally available on the Internet Then either choose part number or if custom component will be used write one page description of the requirements of the component Next telephone the vendor ask to speak to someone in sales and request price information Make sure to inform vendors that the information is for estimation purposes only otherwise they may claim they do not have enough information to determine exact prices Estimating the Costs of Custom Components Custom components which are parts designed especially for the product are made by the manufacturer or by supplier Most custom components are produced using the same types of production processes as standard components injection molding stamping machining however custom parts are typically special purpose parts useful only in particular manufacturer products When the custom component is single part we estimate its cost by adding up the costs of raw materials processing and tooling In cases where the custom component is actually an assembly of several parts then we consider it product in and of itself to arrive at the cost of this product we estimate the cost of each subcomponent and then add assembly and overhead costs these costs are described below For the purposes of this explanation we assume the component is single part The raw materials costs can be estimated by computing the mass of the part allowing for some scrap percent to 50 percent for an injection molded part and 25 percent262 Chapter 13 EXHIBIT Cost estimate for the original intake manifold Note that the processing costs for casting and machining reflect the costs for complete casting line and several machining stations Variable Cost Materials kg aluminum at 25 kg 12 83 Processing casting 150 units hr at 530 hr 53 Processing machining 200 units hr at 340 hr 70 Fixed Cost Tooling for casting 160 000 tool at 500K units tool lifetime 32 Machine tools and fixtures 800 000 ine at 10M units lifetime 18 Total Direct Cost 18 56 Overhead charges 12 09 Total Unit Cost 30 65 to 100 percent for sheet metal part and multiplying by the cost per unit mass of the raw material table of raw material costs is given in Appendix Exhibit 13 17 Processing costs include costs for the operat0r of the processing machinery as well as the cost of using the equipment itself Most standard processing equipment costs between 25 per hour simple stamping press and 75 per hour medium sized computer controlled milling machine to operate including depreciation maintenance utilities and labor costs Estimating the processing time generally requires experience with the type of equipment to be used However it is useful to understand the range of typical costs for common production processes For this purpose tables of approximate processing times and costs are given in Appendix for variety of stampings castings injection moldings and machined parts Tooling costs are incurred for the design and fabrication of the cutters molds dies or fixtures required to use certain machinery to fabricate parts For example an injection molding machine requires custom injection mold for every different type of part it produces These molds generally range in cost from 10 000 to 500 000 Approximate tooling costs are also given for the parts listed in Appendix The unit tooling cost is simply the cost of the tooling divided by the number of units to be made over the life of the tool high quality injection mold or stamping die can usually be used for few million parts The cost of the original intake manifold machined casting is estimated as shown in Exhibit 13 Note that the estimate reveals that the cost is dominated by the expense of the aluminum material We will see that the redesign using composite material not only reduced the material costs but also eliminated machining and allowed many features to be formed into the molded body Estimating the Cost of Assembly Products made of more than one part require assembly For products made in quantities of less than several hundred thousand units per year this assembly is almost always performed manually One exception to this generalization is the assembly of electronic circuit boards which is now almost always done automatically even at relatively low volumes Manual assembly costs can be estimated by summing the estimated time of each assembly operation and multiplying by labor rate Assembly operations require from about seconds to about 60 seconds each depending upon the size of the parts theEXHIBIT Assembly cost estimation for the PCV valve

specialize in particular set of operations and special fixtures and tools can assist the assembly Appendix contains table of approximate times for manual assembly of various products which is helpful in estimating the range of times required for assembly operations popular method for estimating assembly times has been developed over the past 30 years by Boothroyd Dewhurst Inc and is now available as software tool This system involves tabular information system for keeping track of the estimated assembly times for each part The system is supported by comprehensive database of standard handling and insertion times for wide range of situations Special software is also available for estimating the assembly cost of electronic circuit boards Assembly labor can cost from less than per hour in low wage countries to more than 40 per hour in some industrialized nations In the United States assembly labor is likely to cost between 10 and 20 per hour Each firm has different assembly labor cost structures and some industries such as the automobile and aircraft industries have substantially higher cost structures These figures include an allowance for benefits and other worker related expenses and are meant to reflect the true cost to the firm of assembly labor Consider the redesigned intake manifold The assembly cost of the PCV positive crankcase ventilation valve assembly is estimated as shown in Exhibit 13 Estimating the Overhead Costs Accurately estimating overhead costs for new product is difficult and the industry practices are not very satisfying Nevertheless we will describe the standard industry practice here and identify some of its problems Applying the overhead estimation schemes used by most firms is simple Estimating the actual overhead costs incurred by the firm due to particular product is not The indirect costs of supporting production are very difficult to track and assign to particular product lines The future costs of supporting production are even more difficult to predict for new product Most firms assign overhead charges by using overhead rates also called burden rates Overhead rates are typically applied to one or two cost drivers Cost drivers are parameters of the product that are directly measurable Overhead charges are added to direct costs in proportion to the drivers Common cost drivers are the cost of any purchased materials the cost of assembly labor and the number of hours of equipment time the product consumes For example the overhead rate for purchased materials might be 10 percent and the overhead rate for assembly labor might be 80 percent Of course purchased components already have the vendor overhead included in the price we only add the purchasing overhead Under these conditions product containing 100 of purchased components and 10 of assembly labor would incur 18 of overhead costs264 Chapter 13 10 percent of 100 plus 80 percent of 10 Some typical overhead structures are given in Appendix for different types of products and firms The problem with this scheme is that it implies that overhead costs are directly proportional to the cost drivers thought experiment reveals that this cannot always be so Most firms use cost of purchased materials as one cost driver yet why would any of their overhead costs actually change if vendor of 50 component raises its price to 60 The answer is that they would not change at all Overhead rates are used as convenient way to account for overhead costs but this scheme can yield inaccurate estimates of the true costs experienced by the manufacturer to support production This problem is partially addressed by activity based costing ABC methods Kaplan 1990 Under the ABC approach firm utilizes more and different cost drivers and allocates all indirect costs to the associated cost drivers where they fit best As result the firm may have overhead rates applied to various dimensions of product complexity such as the number of different machining operations required or the number of different components or suppliers needed in addition to overhead on tooling materials machine time and direct labor For the purposes of estimating manufacturing costs the use of more cost drivers not only allows more accurate overhead cost estimates to be made but also provides important insights for reducing overhead costs by focusing attention on the cost drivers Step Reduce the Costs of Components For most highly engineered discrete goods the cost of purchased components will be the most significant element of the manufacturing cost This section presents several strategies for minimizing these costs Many of these strategies can be followed even without the benefit of accurate cost estimates In this case these strategies become design rules or rules of thumb to guide DFM cost reduction decisions Understand the Process Constraints and Cost Drivers Some component parts may be costly simply because the designers did not understand the capabilities cost drivers and constraints of the production process For example designer may specify small internal corner radius on machined part without realizing that physically creating such feature requires an expensive electro discharge machining EDM operation designer may specify dimensions with excessively tight tolerances without understanding the difficulty of achieving such accuracy in production Sometimes these costly part features are not even necessary for the component intended function they arise out of lack of knowledge It is often possible to redesign the part to achieve the same performance while avoiding costly manufacturing steps however to do this the design engineer needs to know what types of operations are difficult in production and what drives their costs In some cases the constraints of process can be concisely communicated to designers in the form of design rules For example the capabilities of an automatic laser cutting machine for sheet metal can be concisely communicated in terms of allowable material types material thicknesses maximum part dimensions minimum slot widths and cutting accuracy When this is possible part designers can avoid exceeding the normal capabilities of process and thereby avoid incurring unusually high costs For some processes the cost of producing part is simple mathematical function of some attributes of the part which would be the cost drivers for the process For example EXHIBIT Cost estimate for the redesigned intake manifold two moldings Design for Manufacturing 265 Variable Cost Materials manifold

Unit Cost 13 66 welding process could have cost directly proportional to two attributes of the product the number of welds and the total length of welds the machine creates For processes whose capabilities are not easily described the best strategy is to work closely with the people who deeply understand the part production process These manufacturing experts will generally have plenty of ideas about how to redesign components to reduce production costs Redesign Components to Eliminate Processing Steps Careful scrutiny of the proposed design may lead to suggestions for redesign that can result in simplification of the production process Reducing the number of steps in the part fabrication process generally results in reduced costs as well Some process steps may simply not be necessary For example aluminum parts may not need to be painted especially if they will not be Visible to the user of the product In some cases several steps may be eliminated through substitution of an alternative process step common example of this strategy is net shape fabrication net shape process is one that produces part with the final intended geometry in single manufacturing step Typical examples include molding casting forging and extrusion Frequently designers are able to use one of the net shape processes to create part that is very close to the final requirement near net shape and may demand only minor additional processing drilling and tapping hole cutting to length The original intake manifold required an expensive casting followed by several machining operations The redesigned manifold is molded in two parts to net shape The cost estimate for these two moldings is shown in Exhibit 13 Compare with Exhibit 13 Choose the Appropriate Economic Scale for the Part Process The manufacturing cost of product usually drops as the production volume increases This phenomenon is labeled economies of scale Economies of scale for fabricated component occur for two basic reasons fixed costs are divided among more units and variable costs become lower because the firm can justify the use of larger and more efficient processes and equipment For example consider an injection molded plastic part The part may require mold that costs 50 000 If the firm produces 50 000 units of the part over the product lifetime each part will have to assume of the cost of the mold If however 100 000 units are produced each part will assume only 50 of the266 Chapter 13 EXHIBIT 13 10 Total cost of hypothetical part as function of the number of units produced for injection molding versus machining Machining 10 Unit Materials and Processing Injection Molding Unit Materials and Processing Total Cost fl Mold Cost of 10 000 Fixture Cost of 000 000 Units Number of Units Produced cost of the mold As production volumes increase further the firm may be able to justify four cavity mold for which each cycle of the molding machine produces four parts instead of one As shown in Exhibit 13 the tooling costs for the redesigned intake manifold are quite high however spread over the life of the tool the unit fixed cost is small Processes can be thought of as incurring fixed and variable costs Fixed costs are incurred once per part type regardless of how many parts are produced Variable costs are incurred each time part is made Processes with inherently low fixed costs and high variable costs such as machining are appropriate when few parts will be made while processes with inherently high fixed costs and low variable costs such as injection molding are appropriate when many parts will be made This concept is illustrated by the graph in Exhibit 13 10 As shown in the exhibit if production volume is expected to be below 000 units machining would be more economical otherwise injection molding would incur lower total costs Standardize Components and Processes The principle of economies of scale also applies to the selection of components and processes As the production volume of component increases the unit cost of the component decreases Quality and performance often increase as well with increasing production quantities because the producer of the component can invest in learning and improvement of the component design and its production process For given expected product volume the benefits of substantially higher component volumes can be achieved through the use of standard components Standard components are those common to more than one product This standardization may occur within the product line of single firm or may occur via an outside supplier across the product lines of several firms For example the use of the liter V6 engine in several GM cars is an example of internal standardization The use of common lO millimeter socket head cap screw across several auto manufacturers is an example of external standardization In either case all other things being equal the component unit cost is lower than if the component were used in only single product EXHIBIT 13 An example of standardization within model Wheels of the Ford Explorer are the same on the right and lefi sides of the car Design for Manufacturing 267 Courtesy of Ford Motor Co The redesigned intake manifold is used on all of GM liter V6 engines even though each particular vehicle application requires different EGR exhaust gas recirculation return and vacuum hose routings To accommodate this the new intake manifold has two standard interfaces vacuum port and an EGR port For each vehicle model custom vacuum block and EGR adapter are used This allows the major component the intake manifold to be standardized internally rather than using different manifold for each vehicle Components may also be standardized within the same model For example most auto manufacturers use the same type of wheel on the right and left side of their cars even though this causes directional spokes to have different orientations on different sides Exhibit 13 11 Adhere to Black Box Component Procurement component cost reduction strategy used effectively in the Japanese auto industry is called black box supplier design Under this approach the team provides supplier with only black box description of the component description of what the component has to do not how to achieve it Clark and Fujimoto 1991 This kind of specification leaves the vendor with the widest possible latitude to design or select the component for minimum cost An additional advantage of this approach is that it relieves the internal team of the responsibility to engineer and design the component Successful black box development efforts require careful system level design and extremely clear definitions of the functions interfaces and interactions of each component See Chapter 10 Product Architecture For the redesigned intake manifold the PCV valve assembly was designed by GM AC Rochester Division which supplies the component The supplier was given systemlevel specifications and complete responsibility for the performance of this subsystem 268 Chapter 13 Step Reduce the Costs of Assembly Design for assembly DFA is fairly well established subset of DFM that involves minimizing the cost of assembly For most products assembly contributes relatively small fraction of the total cost Nevertheless focusing attention on assembly costs yields strong indirect benefits Often as result of emphasis on DFA the overall parts count manufacturing complexity and support costs are all reduced along with the assembly cost In this section we present few principles useful to guide DFA decisions Keeping Score Boothroyd and Dewhurst 1989 advocate maintaining an ongoing estimate of the cost of assembly In addition to this absolute score they propose the concept of assembly efficiency This is measured as an index that is the ratio of the theoretical minimum assembly time to an estimate of the actual assembly time for the product This concept is useful in developing an intuition for what drives the cost of assembly The expression for the DFA index is DFA index Theoretical minimum number of parts seconds Estimated total assembly time To determine the theoretical minimum number of parts ask the following three questions of each part in the proposed assembly Only parts satisfying one or more of these conditions must theoretically be separate Does the part need to move relative to the rest of the assembly Small motions that can be accomplished using compliance elastic hinges or springs do not count Must the part be made of different material from the rest of the assembly for fundamental physical reasons Does the part have to be separated from the assembly for assembly access replacement or repair The seconds in the numerator reflects the theoretical minimum time required to handle and insert part that is perfectly suited for assembly One can think of this as the average time sustainable over whole work shift required to assemble small part that is easy to grasp requires no particular orientation and demands no special insertion effort such an operation is as fast as placing ball into circular hole with adequate clearance Integrate Parts If part does not qualify as one of those theoretically necessary then it is candidate for physical integration with one or more other parts The resulting multifunctional component is often very complex as result of the integration of several different geometric features that would otherwise be separate parts Nevertheless molded or stamped parts can often incorporate additional features at little or no added cost Exhibit 13 12 shows the throttlebody end of the redesigned intake manifold Integrated into this component are the attachments for the EGR return and the vacuum source block These attachments use molded push in and turn geometry eliminating the need for several threaded fasteners Part integration provides several benefits Integrated parts do not have to be assembled In effect the assembly of the geometric features of the part is accomplished by the part fabrication process EXHIBIT 13 12 Integration of several features into single component The EGR return and vacuum source ports are molded into the redesigned intake manifold 269 Design for Manufacturing Photo by Stuart Cohen Integrated parts are often less expensive to fabricate than are the separate parts they replace For molded stamped and cast parts this cost savings occurs because single complex mold or die is usually less expensive than two or more less complex molds or dies and because there is usually less processing time and scrap for the single integrated part Integrated parts allow the relationships among critical geometric features to be controlled by the part fabrication process molding rather than by an assembly process This usually means that these dimensions can be more precisely controlled Note however that part integration is not always wise strategy and may be in con flict with other sound approaches to minimizing costs For example the main intake manifold assembly on the old design was single cast piece requiring extensive machining The team replaced this part with two less expensive injection molded pieces This is an example of disintegrating parts in order to achieve benefits in the piece part production costs Maximize Ease of Assembly Two products with an identical number of parts may nevertheless differ in required assembly time by factor of two or three This is because the actual time to grasp orient and insert part depends on the part geometry and the required trajectory of the part insertion The ideal characteristics of part for an assembly are adapted from Boothroyd and Dewhurst 1989 Part is inserted from the top of the assembly This attribute of part and assembly is called axis assembly By using axis assembly for all parts the assembly never has to be inverted gravity helps to stabilize the partial assembly and the assembly worker can generally see the assembly location 270 Chapter 13 Part is self aligning Parts that require fine positioning in order to be assembled require slow precise movements on the part of the assembly worker Parts and assembly sites can be designed to be self aligning so that fine motor control is not required of the worker The most common self alignment feature is the chamfer chamfer can be implemented as tapered lead on the end of peg or conical widening at the opening of hole Part does not need to be oriented Parts requiring correct orientation such as screw require more assembly time than parts requiring no orientation such as sphere In the worst case part must be oriented correctly in three dimensions For example the following parts are listed in order of increasing requirements for orientation sphere cylinder capped cylinder capped and keyed cylinder Part requires only one hand for assembly This characteristic relates primarily to the size of the part and the effort required to manipulate the part All other things being equal parts requiring one hand to assemble require less time than parts requiring two hands which in turn require less effort than parts requiring crane or lift to assemble Part requires no tools Assembly operations requiring tools such as attaching snap rings springs or cotter pins generally require more time than those that do not Part is assembled in single linear motion Pushing in pin requires less time than driving screw For this reason numerous fasteners are commercially available that require only single linear motion for insertion Part is secured immediately upon insertion Some parts require subsequent securing operation such as tightening curing or the addition of another part Until the part is secured the assembly may be unstable requiring extra care fixtures or slower assembly Consider Customer Assembly Customers may tolerate completing some of the product assembly themselves especially if doing so provides other benefits such as making the purchase and handling of the packaged product easier However designing product such that it can be easily and properly assembled by the most inept customers many of whom will ignore directions is substantial challenge in itself Step Reduce the Costs of Supporting Production In working to minimize the costs of components and the costs of assembly the team may also achieve reductions in the demands placed on the production support functions For example reduction in the number of parts reduces the demands on inventory management reduction in assembly content reduces the number of workers required for production and therefore reduces the cost of supervision and human resource management Standardized components reduce the demands on engineering support and quality control There are in addition some direct actions the team can take to reduce the costs of supporting production It is important to remember that manufacturing cost estimates are often insensitive to many of the factors that actually drive overhead charges Recall the discussion of overhead cost estimation above Nevertheless the goal of the design team in this respectDesign for Manufacturing 271

manufacturing system Number of new major tools molds and dies introduced to the manufacturing system Number of new production processes introduced to the manufacturing system Total 13 12 EXHIBIT Scorecard of manufacturing complexity should be to reduce the actual costs of production support even if overhead cost estimates do not change Minimize Systemic Complexity An extremely simple manufacturing system would utilize single process to transform single raw material into single part perhaps system extruding single diameter of plastic rod from plastic pellets Unfortunately few such systems exist Complexity arises from variety in the inputs outputs and transforming processes Many real manufacturing systems involve hundreds of suppliers thousands of different parts hundreds of people dozens of types of products and dozens of types of production processes Each variant of suppliers parts people products and processes introduces complexity to the system These variants must usually be tracked monitored managed inspected handled and inventoried at tremendous cost to the enterprise Much of this complexity is driven by the design of the product and can therefore be minimized through smart design decisions Exhibit 13 13 shows simple scorecard of manufacturing complexity useful for reminding designers of how the product design drives the complexity of the manufacturing system The team establishes score for the initial design and then uses changes in the score as measure of success in reducing complexity Note that the drivers given in the scorecard shown are generic categories In practice the team develops this list and may prioritize it with weightings based on the realities and constraints of the firm production environment Firms that use activity based costing usually know quite well their primary drivers of complexity as these are the cost drivers they use in allocating overhead As simple substitute for an accurate support cost model such scorecard allows the team to make informed decisions without formally estimating the indirect costs of production Error Proofing An important aspect of DFM is to anticipate the possible failure modes of the production system and to take appropriate corrective actions early in the development process This strategy is known as error proofing One type of failure mode arises from having slightly different parts that can be easily confused Examples of slightly different parts are screws differing only in the pitch of the threads 70 mm and 75 mm screws or in the direction of turning left and right handed threads parts that are mirror images of each other and parts differing only in material composition We recommend either that these subtle differences be eliminated or that slight differences be exaggerated Exhibit 13 14 shows an example of exaggerating subtle differences between parts the left and right versions of the reel lock on Videocassette which are272 Chapter 13 EXHIBIT Left and right reel locks inside videocassette top center The two nearly identical parts are color coded to avoid confusion Photo by Stuart Cohen mirror images of each other are molded in two different colors Color coding allows the parts to be identified easily and differentiated in materials handling and assembly Step Consider the Impact of DFM Decisions on Other Factors Minimizing manufacturing cost is not the only objective of the product development process The economic success of product also depends on the quality of the product the timeliness of product introduction and the cost of developing the product There may also be situations in which the economic success of project is compromised in order to maximize the economic success of the entire enterprise In contemplating DFM decision these issues should be considered explicitly The Impact of DFM on Development Time Development time can be precious For an automobile development project time may be worth as much as several hundred thousand dollars per day For this reason DFM decisions must be evaluated for their impact on development time as well as for their impact on manufacturing cost While saving in cost on each manifold would be worth perhaps million in annual cost savings it would almost certainly not be worth causing sixmonth delay in an automobile program The relationship between DFM and development time is complex Here we note few aspects of the relationship The application of some of the DFA guidelines may result in very complex parts These parts may be so complex that their design or the procurement of their tooling becomes the activity that determines the duration of the overall development effort Ulrich et al 1993 The cost benefits of the DFM decision may not be worth the delay in project duration This is particularly true for products competing in dynamic markets The Impact of DFM on Development Cost Development cost closely mirrors development time Therefore the same caution about the relationship between part complexity and development time applies to developmentResults Design for Manufacturing 273 cost In general however teams that aggressively pursue low manufacturing costs as an integral part of the development process seem to be able to develop products in about the same time and with about the same budget as teams that do not Part of this phenomenon certainly arises from the correlation between good project management practices and the application of sound DFM methods The Impact of DFM on Product Quality Before proceeding with DFM decision the team should evaluate the impact of the decision on product quality Under ideal circumstances actions to decrease manufacturing cost would also improve product quality For example the new GM manifold resulted in cost reduction weight reduction and improved engine performance It is not uncommon for DFM efforts focused primarily on manufacturing cost reduction to also result in improved serviceability ease of disassembly and recycling However in some cases actions to decrease manufacturing cost can have adverse effects on product quality such as reliability or robustness so it is advisable for the team to keep in mind the many dimensions of quality that are important for the product The Impact of DFM on External Factors Design decisions may have implications beyond the responsibilities of single development team In economic terms these implications may be viewed as extemalities Two such externalities are component reuse and life cycle costs Component reuse Taking time and money to create low cost component may be of value to other teams designing similar products In general this value is not explicitly accounted for in manufacturing cost estimates The team may choose to take an action that is actually more costly for their product because of the positive cost implications for other projects Life cycle costs Throughout their life cycles certain products may incur some company or societal costs that are not or are rarely accounted for in the manufacturing cost For example products may contain toxic materials requiring special handling in disposal Products may incur service and warranty costs Although these costs may not appear in the manufacturing cost analysis they should be considered before adopting DFM decision Chapter 12 Design for Environment provides detailed method of addressing life cycle costs During the 1980s design for manufacturing practices were put into place in thousands of firms Today DFM is an essential part of almost every product development effort No longer can designers throw the design over the wall to production engineers As result of this emphasis on improved design quality some manufacturers claim to have reduced production costs of products by up to 50 percent In fact comparing current new product designs with earlier generations one can usually identify fewer parts in the new product as well as new materials more integrated and custom parts higher volume standard parts and subassemblies and simpler assembly procedures sketch of the redesigned intake manifold is shown in Exhibit 13 15 This DFM ef fort

percent kilograms Simplified assembly and service procedures Improved emissions performance due to routing of EGR into the manifold Improved engine performance due to reduced air induction temperatures Reduced shipping costs due to lighter components Increased standardization across vehicle programs For this product the manufacturing cost savings alone amount to several million dol lars annually The other benefits listed above are also significant although somewhat more difficult to quantify Summary Design for manufacturing DFM is aimed at reducing manufacturing costs while simultaneously improving or at least not inappropriately compromising product quality development time and development cost DFM begins with the concept development phase and system level design phase in these phases important decisions must be made with the manufacturing cost implications in mind DFM utilizes estimates of manufacturing cost to guide and prioritize cost reduction efforts Cost estimation requires expertise with the relevant production processes Suppliers and manufacturing experts must be involved in this process Since accurate cost estimation is very difficult much of DFM practice involves making informed decisions in the absence of detailed cost data Component costs are reduced by understanding what drives these costs Solutions may involve novel component design concepts or the incremental improvement of existing designs through simplification and standardization Assembly costs can be reduced by following well established design for assembly DFA guidelines Components can be redesigned to simplify assembly operations or components can be eliminated entirely by integration of their functions into other components Reduction of manufacturing support costs begins with an understanding of the drivers of complexity in the production process Design decisions have large impact on the costs of supporting production Choices should be made with these effects in mind even though overhead cost estimates are often insensitive to such changes DFM is an integrative method taking place throughout the development process and requiring inputs from across the development team DFM decisions can affect product development lead time product development cost and product quality Trade offs will frequently be necessary between manufacturing cost and these equally important broader issues 276 Chapter 13 References and Bibliography Many current resources are available on the Internet via www rich eppinger net Two articles describe the needs methods and

percent assembly efficiency DFA index What conditions would have to be met Can you think of any products with very high greater than 75 percent assembly efficiency Is it possible to determine what product really costs once it is put into production If so how might you do this Can you propose set of metrics that would be useful for the team to predict changes in the actual costs of supporting production To be effective these metrics must be sensitive to changes in the design that affect indirect costs experienced by the firm What are some of the barriers to the introduction of such

to all of the tables in this appendix Setup is the work required to prepare the equipment for production run Setup costs are charged for each run Tooling costs are incurred in advance of the first production run and tooling can usually be reused for later production runs However in very high volume production runs tooling wears out and therefore is recurring expense Tooling costs may be spread over the entire production volume or may be charged separately CNC programming time is generally also one time expense like tooling cost Material types are listed for each part Material weights and costs include processing scrap and waste Processing costs vary with the type of manufacturing equipment used and include charges for both machine time and labor While fixed costs setup and tooling are sometimes billed separately from material and processing costs for these examples fixed costs are spread over the production volume shown Unit costs are calculated as Setu costs Toolin costs Varlable costs Total unit cost Volume The cost rates given include overhead charges so these data are representative of custom components purchased from suppliers Description of Processes CNC machining includes computer controlled milling and turning processes CNC machines are highly flexible due to automatic tool changing mechanisms multiple work axes and programmable computer control To produce particular part machinist must first program the cutting tool trajectories and tool selections into the machine computer Also fixtures or other tooling may be utilized to produce multiple parts more efficiently Once the program is written and fixtures are made subsequent production runs can be set up much more quickly Injection molding is the process of forcing hot plastic under high pressure into mold where it cools and solidifies When the part is sufficiently cool the mold is opened the part is ejected the mold closes and the cycle begins again Mold complexity depends highly on the part geometry undercuts features that would prevent the part from ejecting out of the mold are achieved using mold actions or retracting pins Progressive die stamping is the process of passing sheet or strip of metal through set of dies to cut and or form it to desired size and shape While some stampings require only cutting formed stampings are made by bending and stretching the metal beyond its yield point thereby causing permanent deformation Sand castings are created by forming sand mold from master patterns tooling in the shape of the final part Special binders are mixed with the sand to allow the sand to retain shape when packed around the pattern to create single use mold Internal cavities in casting can be created using additional sand cores inside the outer mold Molten metalDesign for Manufacturing 285 is then poured into the mold where the metal cools and solidifies Once cool the sand is broken off to reveal the metal casting Sand castings generally require subsequent machining operations to create finished components Investment castings are made by first creating temporary wax pattern using master tooling The wax pattern is then dipped or immersed in plaster or ceramic slurry which is allowed to solidify The form is then heated melting out the wax and leaving behind only the thin shell as mold Molten metal is then poured into the mold where it cools and solidifies When the metal is cool the mold is broken off to reveal the metal part Detailed process descriptions for the above and numerous other processes as well as more detailed cost estimating
