2 Chapter 1 The economic success of most firms depends on their ability to identify the needs of customers and to quickly create products that meet these needs and can be produced at low cost Achieving these goals is not solely a marketing problem nor is it solely a design problem or a manufacturing problem it is a product development problem involving all of these functions This book provides a collection of methods intended to enhance the abilities of cross functional teams to work together to develop products A product is something sold by an enterprise to its customers Product development is the set of activities beginning with the perception of a market opportunity and ending in the production sale and delivery of a product Although much of the material in this book is useful in the development of any product we explicitly focus on products that are engineered discrete and physical Exhibit 1 1 displays several examples of products from this category Because we focus on engineered products the book applies better to the development of power tools and computer peripherals than to magazines or sweaters Our focus on discrete goods makes the book less applicable to the development of products such as gasoline nylon and paper Because of the focus on physical products we do not emphasize the specific issues involved in developing services or software Even with these restrictions the methods presented apply well to a broad range of products including for example consumer electronics sports equipment scientific instruments machine tools and medical devices The goal of this book is to present in a clear and detailed way a set of product development methods aimed at bringing together the marketing design and manufacturing functions of the enterprise In this introductory chapter we describe some aspects of the industrial practice of product development and provide a of the book Characteristics of Successful Product Development From the perspective of the investors in a for profit enterprise successful product development results in products that can be produced and sold profitably yet profitability is often difficult to assess quickly and directly Five more specific dimensions all of which ultimately relate to profit are commonly used to assess the performance of a product development effort Product quality How good is the product resulting from the development effort Does it satisfy customer needs Is it robust and reliable Product quality is ultimately reflected in market share and the price that customers are willing to pay Product cost What is the manufacturing cost of the product This cost includes spending on capital equipment and tooling as well as the incremental cost of producing each unit of the product Product cost determines how much profit accrues to the firm for a particular sales volume and a particular sales price Development time How quickly did the team complete the product development effort Development time determines how responsive the firm can be to competitive forces and to technological developments as well as how quickly the firm receives the economic returns from the team s efforts Development cost How much did the firm have to spend to develop the product Development cost is usually a significant fraction of the investment required to achieve the profits Introduction 3 Development capability Are the team and the firm better able to develop future products as a result of their experience with a product development project Development capability is an asset the firm can use to develop products more effectively and economically in the future High performance along these five dimensions should ultimately lead to economic success however other performance criteria are also important These criteria arise from interests of other stakeholders in the enterprise including the members of the development team other employees and the community in which the product is manufactured Members of the development team may be interested in creating an inherently exciting product Members of the community in which the product is manufactured may be concerned about the degree to which the product creates jobs Both production workers and users of the product hold the development team accountable to high safety standards whether or not these standards can be justified on the strict basis of profitability Other individuals who may have no direct connection to the firm or the product may demand that the product make ecologically sound use of resources and create minimal dangerous waste products Who Designs and Develops Products Product development is an interdisciplinary activity requiring contributions from nearly all the functions of a firm however three functions are almost always central to a product development project 0 Marketing The marketing function mediates the interactions between the firm and its customers Marketing often facilitates the identification of product opportunities the definition of market segments and the identification of customer needs Marketing also typically arranges for communication between the firm and its customers sets target prices and oversees the launch and promotion of the product Design The design function plays the lead role in defining the physical form of the product to best meet customer needs In this context the design function includes engineering design mechanical electrical software etc and industrial design aesthetics ergonomics user interfaces Manufacturing The manufacturing function is primarily responsible for designing operating and or coordinating the production system in order to produce the product Broadly defined the manufacturing function also often includes purchasing distribution and installation This collection of activities is sometimes called the supply chain Different individuals within these functions often have specific disciplinary training in areas such as market research mechanical engineering electrical engineering materials science or manufacturing operations Several other functions including finance and sales are frequently involved on a part time basis in the development of a new product Beyond these broad functional categories the specific composition of a development team depends on the particular characteristics of the product Few products are developed by a single individual The collection of individuals developing a product forms the project team This team usually has a single team leader who could be drawn from any of the functions of the firm The team can be thought of Chapter 1 Marketing Professional Purchasing Specialist TEAM LEADER Mechanical Core Designer Team Extended Team Including Suppliers Electronics Designer Industrial Designer EXHIBIT 1 2 The composition of a product development team for an electromechanical product of modest complexity consisting of a core team and an extended team In order to work together effectively the core team usually remains small enough to meet in a conference room while the extended team may consist of dozens hundreds or even thousands of other members Even though the term team is inappropriate for a group of thousands the word is often used in this context to emphasize that the group must work toward a common goal In most cases a team within the firm will be supported by individuals or teams at partner companies suppliers and consulting firms Sometimes as is the case for the development of a new airplane the number of external team members may be even greater than that of the team within the company whose name will appear on the final product The composition of a team for the development of an electromechanical product of modest complexity is shown in Exhibit 1 2 Throughout this book we assume that the team is situated within a firm In fact a for profit manufacturing company is the most common institutional setting for product development but other settings are possible Product development teams sometimes work within consulting firms universities government agencies and nonprofit organizations Introduction 5 Stanley Tools Rollerblade

Attributes of five products and their associated development efforts All figures are approximate based on publicly available information and company sources Duration and Cost of Product Development Most people without experience in product development are astounded by how much time and money are required to develop a new product The reality is that very few products can be developed in less than 1 year many require 3 to 5 years and some take as long as 10 years Exhibit 1 1 shows five engineered discrete products Exhibit 1 3 is a table showing the approximate scale of the associated product development efforts along with some distinguishing characteristics of the products The cost of product development is roughly proportional to the number of people on the project team and to the duration of the project In addition to expenses for development effort a firm will almost always have to make some investment in the tooling and equipment required for production This expense is often as large as the rest of the product development budget however it is sometimes useful to think of these expenditures as part of the fixed costs of production For reference purposes this production investment is listed in Exhibit 1 3 along with the development expenditures 6 Chapter I The Challenges of Product Development Developing great products is hard Few companies are highly successful more than half the time These odds present a significant challenge for a product development team Some of the characteristics that make product development challenging are Trade offs An airplane can be made lighter but this action will probably increase manufacturing cost One of the most difficult aspects of product development is recognizing understanding and managing such trade offs in a way that maximizes the success of the product Dynamics Technologies improve customer preferences evolve competitors introduce new products and the macroeconomic environment shifts Decision making in an environment of constant change is a formidable task Details The choice between using screws or snap fits on the enclosure of a computer can have economic implications of millions of dollars Developing a product of even modest complexity may require thousands of such decisions Time pressure Any one of these difficulties would be easily manageable by itself given plenty of time but product development decisions must usually be made quickly and without complete information Economics Developing producing and marketing a new product requires a large investment To earn a reasonable return on this investment the resulting product must be both appealing to customers and relatively inexpensive to produce For many people product development is interesting precisely because it is For others several intrinsic attributes also contribute to its appeal Creation The product development process begins with an idea and ends with the production of a physical artifact When viewed both in its entirety and at the level of individual activities the product development process is intensely creative Satisfaction of societal and individual needs All products are aimed at satisfying needs of some kind Individuals interested in developing new products can almost always find institutional settings in which they can develop products satisfying what they consider to be important needs Team diversity Successful development requires many different skills and talents As a result development teams involve people with a wide range of different training experience perspectives and personalities Team spirit Product development teams are often highly motivated cooperative groups The team members may be so they can focus their collective energy on creating the product This situation can result in lasting camaraderie among team members Approach of This Book We focus on product development activities that benefit from the participation of all the core functions of the firm For our purposes we define the core functions as marketing design and manufacturing We expect that team members have competence in one 7 more specific disciplines such as mechanical engineering electrical engineering industrial design market research or manufacturing operations For this reason we do not discuss for example how to perform a stress analysis or to create a conjoint survey These are disciplinary skills we expect someone on the development team to possess The integrative methods in this book are intended to facilitate problem solving and decision making among people with different disciplinary perspectives Structured Methods The book consists of methods for completing development activities The methods are structured which means we generally provide a step by step approach and often provide templates for the key information systems used by the team We believe structured methods are valuable for three reasons First they make the decision process explicit allowing everyone on the team to understand the decision rationale and reducing the possibility of moving forward with unsupported decisions Second by acting as checklists of the key steps in a development activity they ensure that important issues are not forgotten Third structured methods are largely self documenting in the process of executing the method the team creates a record of the decision making process for reference and for educating newcomers Although the methods are structured they are not intended to be applied blindly The methods are a starting point for continuous improvement Teams should adapt and modify the approaches to meet their own needs and to reflect the unique character of their institutional environment Industrial Examples Each remaining chapter is built around an example drawn from industrial practice The major examples include the following a wireless security system a laser based cat toy a digital copier a cordless screwdriver a mountain bike suspension fork a power nailer a dose metering syringe an electric scooter a computer printer a mobile telephone office seating products an automobile engine a mobile robot a seat belt system a coffee cup insulator a digital photo printer and a microfilm cartridge In most cases we use as examples the simplest products we have access to that illustrate the important aspects of the methods When a screwdriver illustrates an idea as well as a jet engine we use the screwdriver However every method in this book has been used successfully in industrial practice by hundreds of people on both large and small projects Although built around examples the chapters are not intended to be historically accurate case studies We use the examples as a way to illustrate development methods and in doing so we recast some historical details in a way that improves the presentation of the material We also disguise much of the quantitative information in the examples especially financial data Organizational Realities We deliberately chose to present the methods with the assumption that the development team operates in an organizational environment conducive to success In reality some organizations exhibit characteristics that lead to dysfunctional product development teams These characteristics include Lack of empowerment of the team General managers or functional managers may engage in continual intervention in the details of a development project without a full understanding of the basis for the team s decisions 8 Chapter 1 Functional allegiances transcending project goals Representatives of marketing design or manufacturing may influence decisions in order to increase the political standing of themselves or their functions without regard for the overall success of the product Inadequate resources A team may be unable to complete development tasks effectively because of a lack of staff a mismatch of skills or a lack of money equipment or tools Lack of cross functional representation on the project team Key development decisions may be made without involvement of marketing design manufacturing or other critical functions While most organizations exhibit one or more of these characteristics to some degree the significant presence of these problems can be so stifling that sound development methods are rendered ineffective While recognizing the importance of basic organizational issues we assume for clarity of explanation that the development team operates in an environment in which the most restrictive organizational barriers have been removed of the Book We divide the product development process into six phases as shown in Exhibit 1 4 These phases are described in more detail in Chapter 2 Development Processes and Organizations This book describes the concept development phase in its entirety and the remaining phases less completely because we do not provide methods for the more focused development activities that occur later in the process Each of the remaining chapters in this book can be read understood and applied independently 0 Chapter 2 Development Processes and Organizations presents a generic product

developing the product To do this you might start by estimating the information needed to fill out Exhibit 1 3 for the pocket calculator 2 Create a set of scatter charts by plotting each of the rows in Exhibit 1 3 against the development cost row For each one explain why there is or is not any correlation For example you would first plot annual production volume versus development cost and explain why there seems to be no correlation Then repeat for each of the remaining rows Thought Question 1 Each of the chapters listed in Exhibit 1 4 presents a method for a portion of the product development process For each one consider what types of skills and expertise might be required Can you make an argument for staffing the development team from start to finish with individuals

panel shown in Exhibit 2 1 Senior managers at wanted to establish a common product development process structure that would be appropriate for all of the many different operating divisions across the company They also needed to create a product development organization that would allow to compete effectively in a variety of competitive business markets Some of the questions faced were 0 What are the key product development activities that must be included in every project What project milestones and review gates can be used to manage the overall development process by phases Is there a standard development process that will work for every operating division 0 What role do experts from different functional areas play in the development process Should the development organization be divided into groups corresponding to projects or to technical and business functions This chapter helps to answer these and related questions by presenting a generic development process and showing how this process can be adapted to meet the needs of particular industrial situations We highlight the activities and contributions of different functions of the company during each phase of the development process The chapter also explains what constitutes a product development organization and discusses why different types of organizations are appropriate for different settings The Product Development Process A process is a sequence of steps that transforms a set of inputs into a set of outputs Most people are familiar with the idea of physical processes such as those used to bake a cake or to assemble an automobile A product development process is the sequence of steps or activities that an enterprise employs to conceive design and commercialize a product Many of these steps and activities are intellectual and organizational rather than physical Some organizations define and follow a precise and detailed development process while others may not even be able to describe their process Furthermore every organization employs a process at least slightly different from that of every other organization In fact the same enterprise may follow different processes for each of several different types of development projects A well defined development process is useful for the following reasons Quality assurance A development process specifies the phases a development project will pass through and the checkpoints along the way When these phases and checkpoints are chosen wisely following the development process is one way of assuring the quality of the resulting product Coordination A clearly articulated development process acts as a master plan that defines the roles of each of the players on the development team This plan informs the members of the team when their contributions will be needed and with whom they will need to exchange information and materials Development Processes and Organizations 13 Planning A development process includes milestones corresponding to the completion of each phase The timing of these milestones anchors the schedule of the overall development project Management A development process is a benchmark for assessing the performance of an ongoing development effort By comparing the actual events to the established process a manager can identify possible problem areas Improvement The careful documentation and ongoing review of an organization s development process and its results may help to identify opportunities for improvement The generic product development process consists of six phases as illustrated in Exhibit 2 2 The process begins with a planning phase which is the link to advanced research and technology development activities The output of the planning phase is the project s mission statement which is the input required to begin the concept development phase and which serves as a guide to the development team The conclusion of the product development process is the product launch at which time the product becomes available for purchase in the marketplace One way to think about the development process is as the initial creation of a wide set of alternative product concepts and then the subsequent narrowing of alternatives and increasing specification of the product until the product can be reliably and repeatably produced by the production system Note that most of the phases of development are defined in terms of the state of the product although the production process and marketing plans among other tangible outputs are also evolving as development progresses Another way to think about the development process is as an information processing system The process begins with inputs such as the corporate objectives strategic opportunities available technologies product platforms and production systems Various activities process the development information formulating specifications concepts and design details The process concludes when all the information required to support production and sales has been created and communicated A third way to think about the development process is as a risk management system In the early phases of product development various risks are identified and prioritized As the process progresses risks are reduced as the key uncertainties are eliminated and the functions of the product are validated When the process is completed the team should have substantial confidence that the product will work correctly and be well received by the market Exhibit 2 2 also identifies the key activities and responsibilities of the different functions of the organization during each development phase Because of their continuous involvement in the process we choose to articulate the roles of marketing design and manufacturing Representatives from other functions such as research finance project management field service and sales also play key roles at particular points in the process The six phases of the generic development process are 0 Planning The planning activity is often referred to as phase zero because it precedes the project approval and launch of the actual product development process This phase begins with opportunity identification guided by corporate strategy and includes assessment of technology developments and market objectives The output of the planning phase is the project mission statement which specifies the target market for the product business goals key assumptions and constraints Chapter 3 E m j 1 a F D CI 3 ha a c h E o I E O t S stem Level Detail and Production 0 0 Y

the typical tasks and responsibilities of the key business functions for each phase Development Processes and Organizations 15 Identification explains a process for gathering evaluating and choosing from a broad range of product opportunities Chapter 4 Product Planning presents a discussion of the subsequent product planning process 1 Concept development In the concept development phase the needs of the target market are identified alternative product concepts are generated and evaluated and one or more concepts are selected for further development and testing A concept is a description of the form function and features of a product and is usually accompanied by a set of specifications an analysis of competitive products and an economic justification of the project This book presents several detailed methods for the concept development phase Chapters 5 9 We expand this phase into each of its constitutive activities in the next section 2 System level design The system level design phase includes the definition of the product architecture decomposition of the product into subsystems and components and preliminary design of key components Initial plans for the production system and final assembly are usually defined during this phase as well The output of this phase usually includes a geometric layout of the product a functional specification of each of the product s subsystems and a preliminary process flow diagram for the final assembly process Chapter 10 Product Architecture discusses some of the important activities of design 3 Detail design The detail design phase includes the complete specification of the geometry materials and tolerances of all of the unique parts in the product and the identification of all of the standard parts to be purchased from suppliers A process plan is established and tooling is designed for each part to be fabricated within the production system The output of this phase is the control documentation for the product the drawings or computer files describing the geometry of each part and its production tooling the specifications of the purchased parts and the process plans for the fabrication and assembly of the product Three critical issues that are best considered throughout the product development process but are finalized in the detail design phase are materials selection production cost and robust performance These issues are discussed respectively in Chapter 12 Design for Environment Chapter 13 Design for Manufacturing and Chapter 15 Robust Design 4 Testing and refinement The testing and refinement phase involves the construction and evaluation of multiple preproduction versions of the product Early alpha prototypes are usually built with production intent parts parts with the same geometry and material properties as intended for the production version of the product but not necessarily fabricated with the actual processes to be used in production Alpha prototypes are tested to determine whether the product will work as designed and whether the product satisfies the key customer needs Later beta prototypes are usually built with parts supplied by the intended production processes but may not be assembled using the intended final assembly process Beta prototypes are extensively evaluated internally and are also typically tested by customers in their own use environment The goal for the beta prototypes is usually to answer questions about performance and reliability in order to identify necessary engineering changes for the final product Chapter 14 Prototyping presents a thorough discussion of the nature and use of prototypes 16 Chapter 2 5 Production ramp up In the production ramp up phase the product is made using the intended production system The purpose of the ramp up is to train the workforce and to work out any remaining problems in the production processes Products produced during production ramp up are sometimes supplied to preferred customers and are carefully evaluated to identify any remaining flaws The transition from production ramp up to ongoing production is usually gradual At some point in this transition the product is launched and becomes available for widespread distribution A project review may occur shortly after the launch This review includes an assessment of the project from both commercial and technical perspectives and is intended to identify ways to improve the development process for future projects Concept Development The Front End Process Mission Statement Because the concept development phase of the development process demands perhaps more coordination among functions than any other many of the integrative development methods presented in this book are concentrated here In this section we expand the concept development phase into what we call the front end process The front end process generally contains many interrelated activities ordered roughly as shown in Exhibit 2 3 Rarely does the entire process proceed in purely sequential fashion completing each activity before beginning the next In practice the front end activities may be overlapped in time and iteration is often necessary The dashed arrows in Exhibit 2 3 reflect the uncertain nature of progress in product development At almost any stage new information may become available or results learned that can cause the team to step back to repeat an earlier activity before proceeding This repetition of nominally complete activities is known as development iteration The concept development process includes the following activities Identifying customer needs The goal of this activity is to understand customers needs and to effectively communicate them to the development team The output of this step is a set of carefully constructed customer need statements organized in a hierarchical list with importance weightings for many or all of the needs A method for this activity is presented in Chapter 5 Identifying Customer Needs Establishing target specifications Specifications provide a precise description of what a product has to do They are the translation of the customer needs into technical terms Targets for the specifications are set early in the process and represent the hopes I I I u I I I I I I I l l Development Identify Establish Generate Select Test Set Plan Plan Customer Target Product Product Product Final Downstream Needs Specifications Concepts Concept s Concept s Specifications Development Perform Economic Analysis Benchmark Competitive Products Build Models and Prototypes EXHIBIT 2 3 The many front end activities comprising the concept development phase Development Processes and Organizations 17 of the development team Later these specifications are refined to be consistent with the constraints imposed by the team s choice of a product concept The output of this stage is a list of target specifications Each specification consists of a metric and marginal and ideal values for that metric A method for the specification activity is given in Chapter 6 Product Specifications Concept generation The goal of concept generation is to thoroughly explore the space of product concepts that may address the customer needs Concept generation includes a mix of external search creative problem solving within the team and systematic exploration of the various solution fragments the team generates The result of this activity is usually a set of 10 to 20 concepts each typically represented by a sketch and brief descriptive text Chapter 7 Concept Generation describes this activity in detail Concept selection Concept selection is the activity in which various product concepts are analyzed and sequentially eliminated to identify the most promising concept s The process usually requires several iterations and may initiate additional concept generation and refinement A method for this activity is described in Chapter 8 Concept Selection Concept testing One or more concepts are then tested to verify that the customer needs have been met assess the market potential of the product and identify any shortcomings that must be remedied during further development If the customer response is poor the development project may be terminated or some earlier activities may be repeated as necessary Chapter 9 Concept Testing explains a method for this activity Setting final specifications The target specifications set earlier in the process are revisited after a concept has been selected and tested At this point the team must commit to specific values of the metrics reflecting the constraints inherent in the product concept limitations identified through technical modeling and trade offs between cost and performance Chapter 6 Product Specifications explains the details of this activity Project planning In this final activity of concept development the team creates a detailed development schedule devises a strategy to minimize development time and identifies the resources required to complete the project The major results of the front end activities can be usefully captured in a contract book which contains the mission statement the customer needs the details of the selected concept the product specifications the economic analysis of the product the development schedule the project staffing and the budget The contract book serves to document the agreement contract between the team and the senior management of the enterprise A project planning method is presented in Chapter 18 Managing Projects Economic analysis The team often with the support of a financial analyst builds an economic model for the new product This model is used to justify continuation of the overall development program and to resolve specific trade offs between for example development costs and manufacturing costs Economic analysis is shown as one of the ongoing activities in the concept development phase An early economic analysis will almost always be performed before the project even begins and this analysis is updated as more information becomes available A method for this activity is presented in Chapter 17 Product Development Economics Benchmarking of competitive products An understanding of competitive products is critical to successful positioning of a new product and can provide a rich source 8 Chapter 2 ideas for the product and production process design Competitive benchmarking is performed in support of many of the front end activities Various aspects of competitive benchmarking are presented in Chapters 5 9 Modeling and prototyping Every stage of the concept development process involves various forms of models and prototypes These may include among others early concept models which help the development team to demonstrate feasibility models which can be shown to customers to evaluate ergonomics and style spreadsheet models of technical trade offs and experimental test models which can be used to set design parameters for robust performance Methods for modeling prototyping and testing are discussed throughout the book including in Chapters 5 7 9 11 14 and 15 Adapting the Generic Product Development Process The development process described by Exhibits 2 2 and 2 3 is generic and particular processes will differ in accordance with the unique context of the firm and the challenges of any specific project The generic process is most like the process used in a market pull situation a firm begins product development with a market opportunity and then uses whatever available technologies are required to satisfy the market need i e the market pulls the development decisions In addition to the market pull process outlined in Exhibits 2 2 and 2 3 several variants are common and correspond to the following technology push products platform products process intensive products customized products high risk products quick build products and complex systems Each of these situations is described below The characteristics of these situations and the resulting deviations from the generic process are summarized in Exhibit 2 4 Technology Push Products In developing technology push products the firm begins with a new proprietary technology and looks for an appropriate market in which to apply this technology that is the technology pushes development Gore Tex an expanded Teflon sheet manufactured by W L Gore Associates is a striking example of technology push The company has developed dozens of products incorporating Gore Tex including artificial veins for vascular surgery insulation for high performance electric cables fabric for outerwear dental floss and liners for bagpipe bags Many successful technology push products involve basic materials or basic process technologies This may be because basic materials and processes are deployed in thousands of applications and there is therefore a high likelihood that new and unusual characteristics of materials and processes can be matched with an appropriate application The generic product development process can be used with minor modifications for technology push products The technology push process begins with the planning phase in which the given technology is matched with a market opportunity Once this matching has occurred the remainder of the generic development process can be followed The team includes an assumption in the mission statement that the particular technology will be embodied in the product concepts considered by the team Although many extremely successful products have arisen from technology push development this approach can be perilous The product is unlikely to succeed unless I the assumed technology offers a clear competitive advantage in meeting customer needs Processes and Organizations 19 Process Type Generic Market Pull Products Technology Push Products Platform Products Process Intensive Products Customized Products High Risk Products Quick Build Products Complex Systems Description The team begins with a market opportunity and selects appropriate technologies to meet customer needs The team begins with a new technology then finds an appropriate market The team assumes that the new product will be built around an established technological subsystem Characteristics of the product are highly constrained by the production process New products are slight variations of existing configurations Technical or market uncertainties create high risks of failure Rapid modeling and prototyping enables many design build test cycles System must be decomposed into several subsystems and many components Distinct Features Process generally includes distinct planning concept development system level design detail design testing and refinement and production ramp up phases Planning phase involves matching technology and market Concept development assumes a given technology Concept development assumes a proven technology platform Either an existing production process must be specified from the start or both product and process must be developed together from the start Similarity of projects allows for a streamlined and highly structured development process Risks are identified early and tracked throughout the process Analysis and testing activities take place as early as possible Detail design and testing phases are repeated a number of times until the product is completed or time budget runs out Subsystems and components are developed by many teams working in parallel followed by system integration and validation Examples Sporting goods furniture tools Gore Tex envelopes Consumer electronics computers printers Snack foods breakfast cereals chemicals semiconductors Motors switches batteries containers Pharmaceuticals space systems Software cellular phones Airplanes jet engines automobiles EXHIBIT 2 4 Summary of variants of generic product development process 20 Chapter 2 2 suitable alternative technologies are unavailable or very difficult for competitors to utilize Project risk can possibly be minimized by simultaneously considering the merit of a broader set of concepts that do not necessarily incorporate the new technology In this way the team verifies that the product concept embodying the new technology is superior to the alternatives Platform Products A platform product is built around a preexisting technological subsystem a technology platform Examples of such platforms include the Intel in a personal computer the Apple operating system and the blade design in a Gillette razor Huge investments are made in developing such platforms and therefore every attempt is made to incorporate them into several different products In some sense platform products are very similar to technology push products in that the team begins the development effort with an assumption that the product concept will embody a particular technology One difference is that a technology platform has already demonstrated its usefulness in the marketplace in meeting customer needs The firm can in many cases assume that the technology will also be useful in related markets Products built on technology platforms are much simpler to develop than if the technology were developed from scratch For this reason and because of the possible sharing of costs across several products a firm may be able to offer a platform product in markets that could not justify the development of a unique technology Process Intensive Products Examples of process intensive products include semiconductors foods chemicals and paper For these products the production process places strict constraints on the properties of the product so that the product design cannot be separated even at the concept phase from the production process design In many cases process intensive products are produced in very high volumes and are bulk as opposed to discrete goods In some situations a new product and new process are developed simultaneously For example creating a new shape of breakfast cereal or snack food will require both product and process development activities In other cases a specific existing process for making the product is chosen in advance and the product design is constrained by the capabilities of this process This might be true of a new paper product to be made in a particular paper mill or a new semiconductor device to be made in an existing wafer fabrication facility Customized Products Examples of customized products include switches motors batteries and containers Customized products are slight variations of standard configurations and are typically developed in response to a specific order by a customer Development of customized products consists primarily of setting values of design variables such as physical dimensions and materials Templates for specifying customized products may be provided with design tools When a customer orders a new product the firm executes a structured design and development process to create the product to meet the customer s needs Such firms typically have created a highly detailed development process involving a sequence of steps with a structured flow of information analogous to a production process For customized products the generic process is augmented with a Processes and Organizations 21 description of the specific information processing activities required within each of the phases Such development processes may consist of hundreds of carefully defined activities and may be highly automated High Risk Products The product development process addresses many types of risk These include technical risk Will the product function properly market risk Will customers like what the team develops and budget and schedule risk Can the team complete the project on time and within budget High risk products are those that entail unusually large uncertainties related to the technology or market so that there is substantial technical or market risk The generic product development process is modified in high risk situations by taking steps to address the largest risks in the early stages of product development This usually requires completing some design and test activities earlier in the process For example when there is great uncertainty regarding customer acceptance of a new product concept testing using renderings or user interface prototypes may be done very early in the process in order to reduce the market uncertainty and risk If there is high uncertainty related to technical performance of the product it makes sense to build working models of the key features and to test these earlier in the process Multiple solution paths may be explored in parallel to ensure that one of the solutions succeeds Design reviews must assess levels of risk on a regular basis with the expectation that risks are being reduced over time and not being postponed Quick Build Products For the development of some products such as software and many electronics products building and testing prototype models is such a rapid process that the design build test cycle can be repeated many times In fact teams can take advantage of rapid iteration to achieve a more flexible and responsive product development process sometimes called a spiral product development process Following concept development in this process the system level design phase entails decomposition of the product into high medium and low priority features This is followed by several cycles of design build integrate and test activities beginning with the highest priority items This process takes advantage of the fast prototyping cycle by using the result of each cycle to learn how to modify the priorities for the next cycle Customers may even be involved in the testing process after one or more cycles When time or budget runs out usually all of the high and features have been incorporated into the evolving product and the low priority features may be omitted until the next product generation Complex Systems Larger scale products such as automobiles and airplanes are complex systems comprising many interacting subsystems and components When developing complex systems modifications to the generic product development process address a number of system level issues The concept development phase considers the architecture of the entire system and multiple architectures may be considered as competing concepts for the overall system The system level design phase becomes critical During this phase the system is decomposed into subsystems and these further into many components Teams are assigned to develop each component Additional teams are Chapter 2 the special challenge of integrating components into the subsystems and these into the overall system Detail design of the components is a highly parallel process in which the many development teams work at once usually separately Managing the network of interactions across the components and subsystems is the task of systems engineering specialists of many kinds The testing and refinement phase includes not only component and system integration but also extensive testing and validation at all levels Product Development Process Flows The product development process generally follows a structured flow of activity and information flow This allows us to draw process flow diagrams illustrating the process as shown in Exhibit 2 5 The generic process flow diagram a depicts the process used to develop market pull technology push platform process intensive customized and high risk products Each product development phase or stage is followed by a review or gate to confirm that the phase is completed and to determine whether the project proceeds Quick build products enable a spiral product development process b whereby detail design prototyping and test activities are repeated a number of times The

and Organizations 23 development process has been established within an organization a process flow diagram is used to explain the process to everyone on the team The Product Development Process is primarily a market pull enterprise This means that generally drives its development projects based on a perceived market need and utilizes new or established technologies to meet that need Its competitive advantage arises from highly effective marketing channels worldwide strong brand recognition a large installed base of equipment and an ability to integrate new technologies into its product lines For this reason the technology push process would not be appropriate Most products are assembled from components fabricated with relatively conventional processes such as molding machining and electronics assembly Products are generally customized for a particular customer in the final sales and installation processes so the development process at is primarily aimed at creation of new models of products rather than at the customization of existing models therefore established a common product development process similar to the generic phased process The resulting Rally Point process flow is illustrated in Exhibit 2 6 Note that there are nine phases in the Rally Point process with six of the phases from concept definition to process verification comprising the fundamental product development process activities Each phase is followed by a critical review called a Rally Point which is required to gain approval to proceed to the next phase The primary goal and key activities of each phase as well as the business function responsible for each activity are shown in Exhibit 2 7 Although established Rally Point as its standard process managers realized that this process would not be perfectly suitable for all development projects across all business units Therefore one key activity in the concept definition phase is to select a Rally Point process variant if necessary For example some of s new products are based on existing technology platforms To develop such derivative products the team assumes the use of the existing technology platform during concept development Also some products are designed for specific customers as private label variants of standard products In these cases a streamlined process known as Rally Point is used Nevertheless the standard Rally Point product development process is the baseline from which a particular project plan begins CONCEIVE DESIGN OPTIMIZE VERIFY Concept Feasibility Preliminary Final

an effective development process successful firms must organize their product development staff to implement the process in an effective manner In this section we describe several types of organizations used for product development and offer guidelines for choosing among these options Organizations Are Formed by Establishing Links among Individuals A product development organization is the scheme by which individual designers and developers are linked together into groups The links among individuals may be formal or informal and include among others these types Reporting relationships Reporting relationships give rise to the classic notion of supervisor and subordinate These are the formal links most frequently shown on an organization chart Financial arrangements Individuals are linked by being part of the same financial entity such as a business unit or department within a firm Physical layout Links are created between individuals when they share the same office floor building or site These links are often informal arising from spontaneous encounters while at work Any particular individual may be linked in several different ways to other individuals For example an engineer may be linked by a reporting relationship to another engineer in a different building while being linked by physical layout to a marketing person sitting in the next office The strongest organizational links are typically those involving performance evaluation budgets and other resource allocations Organizational Links May Be Aligned with Functions Projects or Both Regardless of their organizational links particular individuals can be classified in two different ways according to their function and according to the projects they work on 0 A function in organizational terms is an area of responsibility usually involving specialized education training or experience The classic functions in product development organizations are marketing design and manufacturing Finer divisions than these are also possible and may include for example market research market strategy stress analysis industrial design human factors engineering process development and operations management Regardless of their functions individuals apply their expertise to specific projects In product development a project is the set of activities in the development process for a particular product and includes for example identifying customer needs and generating product concepts Note that these two classifications must overlap individuals from several different functions will work on the same project Also while most individuals are associated with only one function they may contribute to more than one project Two classic Chapter 2 structures arise from aligning the organizational links according to function or according to projects In functional organizations the organizational links are primarily among those who perform similar functions In project organizations the organizational links are primarily among those who work on the same project For example a strict functional organization might include a group of marketing professionals all sharing similar training and expertise These people would all report to the same manager who would evaluate them and set their salaries The group would have its own budget and the people may sit in the same part of a building This marketing group would be involved in many different projects but there would be no strong organizational links to the other members of each project team There would be similarly arranged groups corresponding to design and to manufacturing A strict project organization would be made up of groups of people from several different functions with each group focused on the development of a specific product or product line These groups would each report to an experienced project manager who might be drawn from any of the functional areas Performance evaluation would be handled by the project manager and members of the team would typically be as much as possible so that they all work in the same office or part of a building New ventures or start ups are among the most extreme examples of project organizations every individual regardless of function is linked together by a single project the growth of the new company and the creation of its product s In these settings the president or CEO can be viewed as the project manager Established firms will sometimes form an autonomous tiger team with dedicated resources for a single project when special focus is required to complete an important development project The matrix organization was conceived as a hybrid of functional and project organizations In the matrix organization individuals are linked to others according to both the project they work on and their function Typically each individual has two supervisors one a project manager and one a functional manager The practical reality is that either the project or the function tends to have stronger links This is because for example both functional and project managers cannot independently assign their shared staff they cannot independently evaluate and determine the salaries of their subordinates and both functional and project organizations cannot easily be grouped together physically As a result either the functional or the project organization tends to dominate Two variants of the matrix organization are called the heavyweight project organization and lightweight project organization Hayes et 1988 A heavyweight project organization contains strong project links The heavyweight project manager has complete budget authority is heavily involved in performance evaluation of the team members and makes most of the major resource allocation decisions Although each participant in a project also belongs to a functional organization the functional managers have relatively little authority and control A heavyweight project team in various industries may be called an integrated product team a design build team or simply a product development team PDT Each of these terms emphasizes the cross functional nature of these teams A lightweight project organization contains weaker project links and relatively stronger functional links In this scheme the project manager is more of a coordinator and administrator The lightweight project manager updates schedules arranges meetings and facilitates coordination but the manager has no real authority and control in the project organization The functional managers are responsible for budgets hiring and firing Processes and Organizations 27 General Manager Functional Managers O 8822 0832 General 0 O l 80 1 1 Manager 00 Q 88 1 1 IT 1 4 Functional Organization Project

Heavyweight Project Matrix Organization Adapted from Hayes et 1988 EXHIBIT 2 8 Various product development organizations For simplicity three functions and three projects are shown performance evaluation Exhibit 2 8 illustrates the pure functional and project organizations along with the heavyweight and lightweight variants of the matrix organization In this book we refer to the project team as the primary organizational unit In this context the team is the set of all people involved in the project regardless of the organizational structure of the product development staff In a functional organization the team consists of individuals distributed throughout the functional groups without any organizational linkages other than their common involvement in a project In the other organizations the team corresponds to a formal organizational entity the project group and has a formally appointed manager For this reason the notion of a team has much more meaning in matrix and project organizations than it does in functional organizations 28 Chapter 2 Choosing an Organizational Structure The most appropriate choice of organizational structure depends on which organizational performance factors are most critical to success Functional organizations tend to breed specialization and deep expertise in the functional areas Project organizations tend to enable rapid and effective coordination among diverse functions Matrix organizations being hybrids have the potential to exhibit some of each of these characteristics The following questions help guide the choice of organizational structure How important is cross functional integration Functional organizations may exhibit difficulty in coordinating project decisions that span the functional areas Project organizations tend to enable strong cross functional integration because of the organizational links of the team members across the functions How critical is cutting edge functional expertise to business success When disciplinary expertise must be developed and retained over several product generations then some functional links are necessary For example in some aerospace companies computational fluid dynamics is so critical that the fluid are organized functionally to ensure the firm will have the best possible capability in this area Can individuals from each function be fully utilized for most of the duration of a project For example a project may require only a portion of an industrial designer s time for a fraction of the duration of a project In order to use industrial design resources efficiently the firm may choose to organize the industrial designers functionally so that several projects can draw on the industrial design resource in exactly the amount needed for a particular project How important is product development speed Project organizations tend to allow for conflicts to be resolved quickly and for individuals from different functions to coordinate their activities efficiently Relatively little time is spent transferring information assigning responsibilities and coordinating tasks For this reason project organizations are usually faster than functional organizations in developing innovative products For example consumer electronics manufacturers almost always organize their product development teams by project This allows the teams to develop new products within the extremely short periods required by the fast paced electronics market Dozens of other issues confound the choice between functional and project organizations Exhibit 2 9 summarizes some of the strengths and weaknesses of each organizational type examples of the types of firms pursuing each strategy and the major issues associated with each approach Distributed Product Development Teams It is well established that a highly effective way to organize a product development team includes of the team members at a single site However the use of modern communication technology and digital development processes allows even globally distributed project teams to be effective Reasons to utilize product development team members located at multiple sites may include the following Access to information about regional markets 0 Availability of technical expertise Development Processes and Organizations 29 Strengths Weaknesses Typical Examples Major Issues Functional Organization Fosters development of deep specialization and expertise Coordination across different functional groups can be slow and bureaucratic Customized products where development involves slight variations to a standard design e g motors bearings packaging How to integrate different functions e g marketing and design to achieve business goals Matrix Organization Lightweight Project Organization Coordination and administration of projects is explicitly assigned to a single project manager Maintains development of specialization and expertise Requires more managers and administrators than a non matrix organization Derivative products in many automobile electronics and aerospace companies Heavyweight Project Organization Provides integration and speed benefits of the project organization Some of the specialization of a functional organization is retained Requires more managers and administrators than a non matrix organization New technology or platform projects in automobile electronics and aerospace companies How to balance functions and projects How to simultaneously evaluate project and functional performance Project Organization Resources can be optimally allocated within the project team Technical and market trade offs can be evaluated quickly Individuals may have difficulty maintaining functional capabilities Start up companies Tiger teams and intended to achieve breakthroughs Firms competing in highly dynamic markets How to maintain functional expertise over time How to share learning from one project to another EXHIBIT 2 9 Characteristics of different organizational structures 0 Location of manufacturing facilities and suppliers Cost saving through lower wages Outsourcing to increase product development capacity Notwithstanding the importance of using the right team members regardless of location firms implementing globally distributed product development have experienced many challenges due to the weaker ties between team members separated by great distances This may result in an increased number of design iterations and more difficult project coordination particularly when such teams are newly formed Fortunately organizations having years of experience with global project teams report that distributed projects do work more smoothly over time 30 Chapter 2 The Product Development Organization The primary functions involved in product development at are engineering manufacturing marketing sales purchasing quality assurance finance legal and project management as listed in Exhibit 2 7 Each of these functions has a manager who reports to the general manager of the division However product development projects are led by project managers with the resources for each project drawn from the functional areas In terms of the variants described in Exhibits 2 8 and 2 9 product development at primarily takes place in projects strongly reflecting a traditional functional organization structure Project leaders are given only indirect control of the functional resources assigned to their teams As explained above a functional structure generally sacrifices some project efficiency in favor of greater ongoing development of the functional skills To address this concern has created a highly effective project management function with project leaders who know the Rally Point process and how to coordinate the activities across the functions This organizational choice has indeed led to very good product development performance for while maintaining very strong functional capabilities In recent years has created new regional engineering centers at locations in markets such as China and India Engineers at these centers are able to support product development projects across multiple business units around the world This arrangement improves project performance by augmenting any project team with additional technical resources on an as needed basis which is particularly helpful in the later stages of the Rally Point process Summary An enterprise must make two important decisions about the way it carries out product development It must define both a product development process and a product development organization A product development process is the sequence of steps an enterprise employs to conceive design and commercialize a product A well defined development process helps to ensure product quality facilitate coordination among team members plan the development project and continuously improve the process 0 The generic process presented in this chapter includes six phases planning concept development system level design detail design testing and refinement and production ramp up The concept development phase requires tremendous integration across the different functions on the development team This front end process includes identifying customer needs analyzing competitive products establishing target specifications generating product concepts selecting one or more final concepts setting final specifications testing the concept s performing an economic analysis and planning the remaining project activities The results of the concept development phase are documented in a contract book The development process employed by a particular firm may differ somewhat from the generic process described here The generic process is most appropriate for market Processes and Organizations 31 products Other types of products which may require variants of the generic process include technology push products platform products process intensive products customized products high risk products quick build products and complex systems Regardless of the development process tasks are completed by individuals residing in organizations Organizations are defined by linking individuals through reporting relationships financial relationships and or physical layout 0 Functional organizations are those in which the organizational links correspond to the development functions Project organizations are those in which the organizational links correspond to the development projects Two types of hybrid or matrix organization are the heavyweight project organization and the lightweight project organization The classic trade off between functional organizations and project organizations is between deep functional expertise and coordination efficiency Globally distributed product development teams allow access to specialized resources market information and or technical expertise However global teams experience higher

EXHIBIT 3 1 The Bolt laser based cat toy the original product of the brand 1 Many of the ideas in this chapter were developed in collaboration with Christian and are described in more detail in the book Innovation Tournaments and Ulrich 2009 3334 Chapter 3 The pet products company had introduced two successful laser based cat toys including the Bolt Exhibit 3 1 a product that embodies a randomly moving laser beam to entertain cats The company s management team hoping to build upon their initial success sought additional opportunities to develop new cat toys They were particularly interested in opportunities to extend their brand to other types of motion based cat toys was a small company and so an investment in developing a new product represented substantial financial risk As a result the team hoped to identify opportunities that would be highly likely to result in profitable products was based in Chicago but because all of s products were produced by factories in China and because it wished to adopt a more global market perspective it engaged a Shanghai based product development consulting firm Design to lead the opportunity identification effort This chapter provides a conceptual foundation for opportunity identification and articulates a six step process which includes generating a large number of alternatives and filtering them to identify those that are exceptionally promising We illustrate the opportunity identification process using the example What Is an Opportunity In the context of product development an opportunity is an idea for a new product An opportunity is a product description in embryonic form a newly sensed need a newly discovered technology or a rough match between a need and a possible solution At the earliest stage of development uncertainty clouds the future so an opportunity can be thought of as a hypothesis about how value might be created For a consumer products company like Gamble an opportunity might be a new type of cleaner suggested by a customer For a materials company like it might be a new polymer with unusual properties Some opportunities ultimately become new products while others never warrant substantial further development An opportunity for a new product is usually articulated with less than one page of information often including a descriptive title a narrative explaining the idea and sometimes including a sketch of a possible product concept Exhibit 3 2 shows the opportunity eventually pursued by as it was first articulated following a brainstorming session by members of the team The opportunity was for an interactive cat toy consisting of a swinging object hanging from the underside of a table which would be moved around by a hand from above This is an example of an opportunity that includes a possible solution concept which is typical for efforts focused on identifying opportunities for new products in a well defined category like cat toys Types of Opportunities While there are many ways to categorize opportunities two dimensions are particularly useful They are l the extent to which the team is familiar with the solution likely to be employed and 2 the extent to which the team is familiar with the need that the Identification 35 Courtesy of Lucky Litter and Future Life Labs EXHIBIT 3 2 The swinging ball opportunity eventually pursued by the team as first recorded in a sketch This is an example of an opportunity that includes a potential solution concept addresses For technology based products these dimensions can also be thought of as knowledge of the technology and knowledge of the market These two dimensions are illustrated in Exhibit 3 3 Because risk of failure increases as opportunities deviate from what the team already knows well we can divide the opportunity landscape into categories based on the uncertainty horizon faced by the team Horizon 1 opportunities are largely improvements extensions variants and cost reductions of existing products for existing markets They are relatively low risk opportunities Horizon 2 opportunities push out into less known territory in one or both of the dimensions of the market or the technology Horizon 3 opportunities represent attempts to exploit opportunities that in some way are new to the world embodying the highest level of uncertainty Because of the need to launch a product within about a year the team explicitly avoided Horizon 3 opportunities The team wished to build on its initial success with the Bolt cat toy and so focused on its existing customers and the existing needs it already addressed It sought a next generation solution for the existing need to entertain cats and thus focused on Horizon 2 opportunities 36 Chapter 3 New Exploration into New category need market

levels of risk reflecting different types of uncertainty Source and Ulrich 2009 Tournament Structure of Opportunity Identification Opportunities vary widely in value however that value is plagued by uncertainty It is therefore very useful to identify a set of opportunities and then to select a subset for further development with just a few coming to fruition This process can be thought of as an innovation tournament with only the best ideas prevailing In most settings dozens hundreds or even thousands of opportunities are considered for every one commercial success A filtering process selects a subset for further development and from those picks one or more champions that will be launched as full product development efforts Exhibit 3 4 illustrates this tournament structure The opportunity identification process embodied in an innovation tournament precedes the product development process as shown in Exhibit 3 4 While both the opportunity identification process and the product development process consist of development steps and selection steps the overarching goals of the two activities are quite different In opportunity identification the goal is to generate a large number of opportunities and efficiently kill those that are not worthy of further investment In the product Opportunity Identification 37 O O 79 O O O O O O O O O O O 0 Concept System Level

opportunity identification process The opportunity tournament feeds the product development process with exceptional opportunities Source and Ulrich 2009 process the goal is to take the opportunity articulated in the mission statement and do everything possible to assure it becomes the best product it can be Although opportunity identification and product development can be thought of as separate activities there is clearly some overlap between them For example in a consumer product business like preliminary product concepts are almost always generated and explored with prototypes during the opportunity identification process before a formal product development process begins However these exploratory activities are typically conducted for several alternative opportunities with only the most promising proceeding to more comprehensive product design and development Exhibit 3 5 illustrates the opportunity identification tournament structure used by starting with 50 opportunities and eventually resulting in one chosen to go into full product development Effective Opportunity Tournaments Given that great opportunities are rare how can the opportunity identification process be managed to increase the number of excellent opportunities identified There are three basic ways 1 Generate a large number of opportunities If you produce more opportunities you ll see more exceptional ones The logic here is simple on average if you find one 7 foot 213 cm tall person per 100 000 people you ll find two among 200 000 Creating more opportunities without sacrificing their average quality is thus a key lever in finding the exceptional few 38 Chapter 3 1 Opportunity Articulated as a Mission Statement for Product 3 Opportunities with Exploratory Prototypes and Sample Packaging 50 Raw Opportunities 7 Opportunities with Representative Product Concepts Images courtesy of Lucky Litter and Future Life Labs EXHIBIT 3 5 The overall tournament structure of the opportunity identification process for Fifty raw opportunities were eventually filtered and explored resulting in a swinging ball opportunity that was developed into a product launched to the market Opportunity Identification 39 2 Seek high quality of the opportunities generated Adopting better methods for generating opportunities and mining better sources of opportunities can increase the average quality of the opportunities under consideration which will also increase the quality of the best ideas resulting from the tournament 3 Create high variance in the quality of opportunities This is a direct though not immediately obvious implication of statistics Holding the average quality and number of opportunities constant you ll generate more exceptional ones from a process that exhibits greater variability that is if it s less consistent in the quality of its output The quest for variability contradicts normal approaches to process improvement but it s exactly what you want in opportunity creation Generating wacky ideas and wild notions increases the chance that at least one of the opportunities will be exceptionally good Opportunity Identification Process We divide the opportunity identification process into six steps as follows Establish a charter Generate and sense many opportunities Screen opportunities Develop promising opportunities Select exceptional opportunities 99 5 Reflect on the results and the process Each step is the focus of a section of this chapter Step 1 Establish a Charter Organizations create new products to achieve goals such as growing revenues from existing customers filling a hole in a product line or entering new market segments Entrepreneurs starting new organizations also have goals like creating a new product related to an area of personal interest The innovation charter articulates these goals and establishes the boundary conditions for an innovation effort Charters are closely analogous to although somewhat broader than the mission statement for a new product See Chapter 4 Product Flaming For example the charter for the effort was Create a physical product in the cat toy category that we can launch to the market within about a year through our existing retail sales channel The main restrictions in this charter were the emphasis on physical goods instead of software or services a focus on the cat toy category a preference for opportunities that would not require enormous investments of calendar time and a desire to take advantage of the company s existing relationships with retailers The charter requires resolving a tension between leaving the innovation problem unconstrained and specifying a direction that is likely to meet the goals of the team and organization By specifying a narrow charter the team avoids wasting effort Chapter 3 opportunities in areas that are unlikely to be pursued On the other hand sometimes deciding which opportunities are worthy of pursuit in advance and in the abstract is difficult Similar to the mission statement for a new product we recommend that the innovation charter be broad perhaps a bit broader than the team is comfortable with Generating ideas is inexpensive and sharpening the focus later is not difficult The benefit of allowing a broad focus is that opportunities that may otherwise have never been considered will challenge the team s assumptions about what kinds of opportunities it should pursue Step 2 Generate and Sense Many Opportunities Based on a survey of companies across many industries about half of innovation opportunities are generated internally to an organization and about half are recognized from customers and other external sources and Ulrich 2009 The distribution of sources of opportunities is shown in Exhibit 3 6 We therefore recommend that the team explicitly focus on both internal and external sources of opportunities Typically the team will want to identify dozens if not hundreds of raw opportunities Fortunately this daunting task is made much easier through the application of some structured techniques which we outline here Techniques for Generating Opportunities For some creative people there is nothing more fun than coming up with new ideas However we find that the majority of people have a hard time when asked simply to generate some promising opportunities For them the problem of coming up with something new is simply too abstract too unstructured and has too many degrees of freedom Following are seven basic techniques for stimulating the identification of opportunities Most work well in both entrepreneurial and corporate settings Internally generated Customer Competitive product Sales force University Independent inventor Distribution partner Other partner company Supplier 20 30

inventor Matt nutrient pouch tubing and valve on his right side Follow a Personal Passion List your passions endeavors that keep you awake with excitement and then consider how emerging technologies trends and business models might influence them Or identify unmet needs that you have in connection with a personal interest An avid bicyclist whom we know has been developing a nutrient delivery system for use with existing hydration backpacks for example which has applications for the military and for a wide variety of sports Exhibit 3 7 He identified the opportunity while reflecting on his desire to adjust the amount of sugar and electrolytes in the beverages in his hydration pack Compile Bug Lists Successful innovators are often chronically dissatisfied with the world around them They notice unmet needs of users including themselves List or photograph every annoyance or frustration you encounter over a period of days or weeks and then pick the most universal and vexing ones and dream up solutions Any problem is an opportunity An annoyance that gives birth to the opportunity t have to be yours alone Instead you might find it through customer complaints or market research A powerful way to understand others annoyances is to immerse yourself in the world of people using your products or services Pull Opportunities from Capabilities Theories of competitive advantage abound but most spring from the idea that firms achieve above average profits by exploiting unique resources Resources an Chapter 3 term includes capabilities core competencies and competitive advantage To provide advantage a resource must be Valuable To be valuable a resource must either allow a firm to achieve greater performance than competitors or reduce a weakness relative to competitors 0 Rare Given competition a valuable resource must be rare 0 Inimitable For value and rarity to persist a resource must not be easily imitated Even if valuable rare and inimitable a resource providing advantage can t be easily substituted This perspective abbreviated as can be used to define targets by first articulating an inventory of resources and then using the inventory as a lens for opportunity generation Apple Computer s resources for example might include excellence in industrial design a leading brand and a loyal customer base Each of these resources can guide the opportunity creation process by reformulating them as a challenge For example In what other product categories might Apple s design excellence create advantage For which product or service categories could the Apple brand be deployed to advantage What other products or services could Apple provide to its customer base Study Customers Opportunities can be identified by studying customers in a selected market segment These studies also called user anthropology or consumer ethnography provide a deeper understanding of the true customer needs than you can obtain through surveys Consider the bicycle industry a maker of bike components like pedals and brakes recently commissioned a user anthropology study to understand why more people in the United States don t ride bikes The traditional approach to this problem would have been to create a survey or a set of focus groups asking customers how often they ride and what attributes of a bike they value the most Most likely most Americans would say that they ride regularly which for some might mean once a year and that they want light bikes with many gears Those after all are the product attributes emphasized in nearly every bike shop Unfortunately what people say to researchers and what they really do can differ substantially By spending many hours observing potential cyclists including time on and off bicycles s researchers found that many consumers want bikes that are technically simple easy to ride and easy to get on and off all attributes that t emphasized in the current competition among bicycle manufacturers who tend to emphasize the needs of biking enthusiasts User anthropology thus helped to identify a set of latent needs See Chapter 5 Identifying Customer Needs for a description of latent needs When a latent need is articulated it becomes a target for the opportunity creation process Once they identified the factors that keep many potential customers in their automobiles as opposed to on their bikes they had the opportunity to redefine the product category In the case of these efforts led to the creation of bikes targeted specifically at the leisure rider that is people who might rent a bike during their annual family trip to the beach but otherwise t riding regularly developed a line of components under the brand Coasting and manufacturers then incorporated them into their bikes One example is the Trek Lime shown in Exhibit 3 8 Opportunity Identification 43 Courtesy of Trek EXHIBIT 3 8 The Trek Lime bicycle incorporating the Coasting component group Consider Implications of Trends Changes in technology demography or social norms often create innovation opportunities Ubiquitous mobile telephone service for example enables a wide variety of information delivery services An increasing Spanish speaking population in the United States for example enables new sorts of Spanish language media Growing environmental awareness creates a market for green products and services Once again the means of exploration is easy list social environmental technological or economic trends and then imagine innovation opportunities made possible by each one Imitate but Better When another firm innovates successfully it in effect publishes the location of a gold mine You can exploit this information by either considering alternative solutions that could address the same need or alternative needs that could be addressed with the same solution Exhibit 3 9 shows examples of the imitate but better approach Here are some sources of opportunities for imitation Media and marketing activities of other firms Scan the media and monitor the activities of other firms by attending trade shows and following patent filings for example Articulate the need and solution associated with any innovation that you identify Generate alternative approaches to meeting the need or alternative needs that can be addressed with the new approach 0 De a commodity Often price competition characterizes a product category and the offerings themselves are little more than commodities Recall coffee before or breath mints before A situation like this creates an opportunity for innovation To pursue this kind of innovation list all of the inexpensive undifferentiated products or services in a category and then consider the possibility of deluxe versions 44 r Photos The McGraw Hill Companies Inc J ill photographer Ingram Publishing Photos Photos Existing Product Imitate but Better Product EXHIBIT 3 9 Examples of the imitate but better approach Opportunity Identification 45 Drive an innovation down market Four entrepreneurs with a history in the toy and candy businesses invented the Crest in 1998 They believed that their competitive advantage was in creating small cheap battery powered devices as they had done with the Spin Pop a lollipop spun by a little motor They were struck by the array of electric toothbrushes many selling for about 100 yet none having much more complexity than their spinning lollipops They decided to create an electric toothbrush that can sell for six dollars Their became the best selling toothbrush of any type To follow their example list the premium products or services in a category and then imagine much cheaper versions that provide many of the same benefits Import geographically isolated innovations Innovations are often geographically isolated particularly if introduced by smaller firms Translating the innovation from one geographic region to another can be a source of innovation The Red Bull energy drink started as a product for Thai truck drivers founder Howard Schultz created the chain after visiting Milan and becoming infatuated with its culture and espresso based drinks Mine Your Sources Recall that about half of product opportunities arise from sources inside an organization and about half come from outside sources As a result you benefit from cultivating external sources of ideas Those sources include the following Lead users Firms have ample incentive to innovate Innovation after all can result in new sources of cash But lead users and independent inventors may have even greater incentives Lead users are people or firms that have advanced needs that may not be met by existing products or services Lead users must either tolerate their unmet needs or innovate themselves to address them Many devices and procedures in health care were invented by clinicians For example consider Dr Lillian a veterinarian at the University of Pennsylvania who performs feline liver transplants Her procedure is relatively new the market is small and few existing surgical tools fit the task Dr thus has to choose between ill suited instruments and inventing her own If she invents a useful device she creates an opportunity for further innovation by an established firm Representation in social networks Another way to increase the keenness of your sensing is to ensure that you are plugged into the appropriate social networks Social institutions of all kinds facilitate communication among innovators Some of these institutions may not be related to professional life Cricket and softball leagues in Silicon Valley are widely known to be hotbeds of entrepreneurial activity and have played a key role in facilitating the exchange of ideas leading to opportunities for new products social networking communities and discussion forums also may foster communication among innovators Universities and government laboratories Students research staff and professors continually pursue novel solutions to vexing challenges In many cases the solutions identified in universities and government laboratories can be commercialized by third parties including existing companies and start ups Research universities and government laboratories have technology transfer organizations to facilitate this process idea submission Opportunities may be collected from customers and through Web sites For example the computer company Dell runs a Web site for soliciting innovation opportunities from customers 46 Chapter 3 Step 3 Screen Opportunities The goal of screening is simply to eliminate opportunities that are highly unlikely to result in the creation of value and to focus attention on the opportunities worthy of further investigation The aim is not to pick the single best opportunity Given many opportunities to be screened the process must be relatively efficient even at the expense of perfect accuracy For this step a very effective screening criterion is the holistic judgment by a group of individuals of whether or not the opportunity is worthy of a few days or weeks of additional investigation Separate application of multiple screening criteria e g market need technological feasibility alignment with strategy tends to bog down the process in unnecessary discussion Recall that in most settings you will have dozens or even hundreds of raw opportunities to consider Two methods are effective approaches to screening Web based surveys and workshops with Both methods rely on the independent judgments of a group of people Typically this group comprises members of your organization but could be an extended entrepreneurial team or even friends and family members with relevant expertise Of course the group performing the evaluation must have relevant expertise even if that expertise varies in type and depth A Web based interface can ensure that the participants don t know the author of each idea so they will base their votes on the quality of the opportunity not their opinion of its originator Many free Web based survey tools are available or you can use one of the tools designed specifically for the purpose of evaluating innovation opportunities A Web based screening survey can be as simple as a listing of opportunities with short descriptions for which you ask respondents simply to indicate a yes no vote on whether or not the opportunity deserves further investment Alternatively you can use a 1 10 scale which may be useful if you have a relatively small group of people voting In our experience you need at least six independent judgments and preferably more than 10 to make reliable decisions You can also use an in person workshop to evaluate opportunities In a format we have used frequently each participant presents one or more opportunities to the group These presentations can be supported by a single slide page or flip chart sheet We strongly recommend that these presentations be limited to about one minute and that each presenter adhere to the same time limit and format Summaries of each opportunity may be distributed in advance of the workshop Following the presentations you ask a group of raters to on the opportunities With you display opportunities on pages or flip chart sheets posted on the walls of the room where you re conducting your workshop Raters are given dots or other types of stickers to register their votes They simply apply their stickers to the opportunities they favor Another way that may be applied in the product development process is for choosing the most promising concepts See Chapter 8 Concept Selection We recommend that you number the opportunities and ask voters to write the number of the opportunity they will vote for on each of their stickers They do this quietly as a group before actually applying the stickers to the sheets Then everyone places their stickers simultaneously By this method you avoid influencing the voting decisions with information about how others have voted Workshops work well for reviewing up to about 50 opportunities For more than 50 we suggest first doing a round of Web based screening Opportunity Identification 47 Regardless of which voting method you choose we suggest that you consider advancing not only the ideas receiving the most votes but also those with only a few very enthusiastic supporters Strong opinions often point to exceptional ideas Remember that your goal is to efficiently eliminate opportunities that are not worthy of further investment but to avoid killing a potentially great idea The team had developed 50 raw opportunities as the result of the efforts of six individuals working independently and in brainstorming sessions The team members identified seven opportunities they felt were worthy of further development by aggregating the individual judgments of the team members including both product designers at and marketing managers at Step 4 Develop Promising Opportunities Rarely does it make sense to bet on a single opportunity Too much uncertainty clouds the prospects for success After screening opportunities the team should invest modest levels of resources in developing a few of them At a minimum an opportunity passing the initial screen warrants an Internet search for existing solutions and an informal discussion with a few potential customers Some additional tasks that are often worth completing include customer interviews testing of existing products concept generation quick prototypes and estimates of market sizes and growth rates You might invest a few days to a few weeks in each of several promising opportunities In developing promising opportunities the goal is to resolve the greatest uncertainty surrounding each one at the lowest cost in time and money One way to structure this step is to list the major uncertainties regarding the success of each opportunity the tasks you could take to resolve the uncertainties and the approximate cost of each task Then perform the tasks that resolve the most uncertainty at the lowest cost For example an opportunity based on a clever concept might not be very valuable if a patent is unlikely A cursory patent search takes just a couple of hours and so that is a task that should be completed early in the process of developing the opportunity The team explored the seven opportunities shown in Exhibit 3 5 and selected three opportunities for further development The subsequent development tasks were to build functional prototypes and test them with cats and cat owners to create packaging concepts and test their appeal with consumers and to complete financial analysis based on likely manufacturing costs and price points Step 5 Select Exceptional Opportunities Once a handful of opportunities have been developed with modest investment of resources enough uncertainty should be resolved in order to pick the exceptional few opportunities that warrant a significant investment in product development Chapter 8 Concept Selection describes how to choose a design concept by comparing alternatives against selection criteria The same basic method can be used to select product opportunities One specific approach used within established companies is the Real Win Worth it method developed originally by Day 2007 The name 48 Chapter 3 Real Win Worth it summarizes the three questions an organization should attempt to answer when screening opportunities 0 Is the opportunity real Is there a real market that you can serve with the product Criteria here include market size potential pricing availability of technology and the likelihood the product can be delivered in the required volume at the required cost Can you win with this opportunity Can you establish a sustainable competitive advantage Can you patent or brand the idea Are you more capable of executing it than competitors For example do you have superior engineering talent in this field 0 Is the opportunity worth it financially Do you have the resources needed financial and developmental and are you confident that the investment will be rewarded with appropriate returns Exhibit 3 10 shows the criteria applied to the swinging ball opportunity for An analysis like this one done for each opportunity allows the team to narrow the opportunities to the exceptional few For the swinging ball concept was highly appealing to potential purchasers was engaging for cats offered the prospect of a good patent and could be developed and launched with modest investment These factors distinguished the opportunity from the others Real Win Worth it Framework Swing Ball Cat Toy Example 1 Is there a real market and a real product Is there a need What is the need How is the need presently satisfied Yes Can the customer buy size of the market customer decision making process Yes Will the customer buy perceived risks and benefits expectations on price and availability Yes Is there a viable concept for a product already How likely are we to be able to develop a viable concept Yes Is the product acceptable within the social legal and environmental norms Yes Is the product feasible Can it be made Is the technology available Does it satisfy the needs Yes Will our product satisfy the market Is there a relative advantage to other products Yes Can it be produced at low cost Yes Are the risks perceived by the customer acceptable What are the barriers to adoption E Answer YES 2 Can we win Can our product or service be competitive Can we succeed as a company Do we have a competitive advantage Is it sustainable performance patents barriers to entry substitution price Yes Is the timing right Yes Does it fit our brand Yes Will we beat our competition How much will they improve price trajectories entrants Yes Do we have superior resources engineering finance marketing production fit with core competencies No Do we have the management that can win experience fit with culture commitment to this opportunity Yes Do we know the market as well as or better than our competitors customer behavior channels 3 Answer YES 3 Is it worth doing Is the return adequate and the risk acceptable Will it make money Yes Do we have the resources and the cash to do this Yes Are the risks acceptable to us What could go wrong technical risk vs market risk Yes Does it fit our strategy fit with our growth expectation impact on brand embedded options E Answer YES EXHIBIT 3 1 0 The Real Win Worth it criteria applied to the swinging ball opportunity The checklist is available from the book Web site Opportunity Identification 49 This same selection method can be applied using other criteria An entrepreneur starting a new business will use different criteria from those of an established company For example in addition to or instead of the Real Win Worth it criteria an entrepreneur might select opportunities based on the amount of capital required the time required to get to market or the passion and excitement invoked by the opportunity Step 6 Reflect on the Results and the Process The team pursued the swing ball opportunity and developed a product for sale Exhibit 3 11 which was named the Sway The Sway was launched through major retailers such as Amazon The team anxiously awaited the market response which would be a key indicator of the success of their opportunity identification process However market success is not the only success criterion for the process Some questions to consider in reflecting on the opportunity identification results and process are 0 How many of the opportunities identified came from internal sources versus external sources Did we consider dozens or hundreds of opportunities 0 Was the innovation charter too narrowly focused Were our filtering criteria biased or largely based on the best possible estimates of eventual product success 0 Are the resulting opportunities exciting to the team EXHIBIT 3 1 1 The Sway cat toy product that resulted from the swinging ball opportunity 50 Chapter 3 Summary This chapter articulates a conceptual framework for opportunity identification as a tournament in which a large number of raw opportunities are generated and then filtered and explored in order to narrow those opportunities to an exceptional few The opportunity identification process includes six steps Establish a charter Generate and sense many opportunities Screen opportunities Develop promising opportunities Select exceptional opportunities PP NI Reflect on the results and the process The performance of the opportunity identification process depends on considering a large number of opportunities from a variety of sources applying idea generation processes that result in good opportunities and in considering opportunities of widely varying quality By systematically filtering and developing a large set of raw opportunities to identify an exceptional few for further development the resources of the organization are put to their best use References and Bibliography Many current resources including the Real Win Worth it spreadsheet and Web based software for evaluating opportunities are

Xerox EXHIBIT 4 1 The Lakes project developed a new copier platform including this new product the Xerox Document 265 5354 Chapter 4 Xerox Corporation is a global enterprise offering a wide array of document related products services and business solutions Its mission is to be the leader in the global document market providing document solutions that enhance business productivity A key element of Xerox s competitive strategy is to exploit technological innovation in a rapidly changing market Pursuing this strategy requires the ability to choose the right set of development projects and to define the scope of these projects in such a way that the projects are complementary Exhibit 4 1 is a photo of the Xerox Document 265 a product resulting from a Xerox project code named Lakes The product planning process takes place before a product development project is formally approved before substantial resources are applied and before the larger development team is formed Product planning is an activity that considers the portfolio of projects that an organization might pursue and determines what subset of these projects will be pursued over what time period The product planning activity ensures that product development projects support the broader business strategy of the company and addresses these questions What product development projects will be undertaken 0 What mix of fundamentally new products platforms and derivative products should be pursued How do the various projects relate to each other as a portfolio 0 What will be the timing and sequence of the projects Each of the selected projects is then completed by a product development team The team needs to know its mission before beginning development The answers to these critical questions are included in a mission statement for the team What market segments should be considered in designing the product and developing its features 0 What new technologies if any should be incorporated into the new product 0 What are the manufacturing and service goals and constraints 0 What are the financial targets for the project 0 What are the budget and time frame for the project This chapter explains how an organization can maximize the effectiveness of its product development efforts by first considering the set of potential projects it might pursue deciding which projects are most desirable and then launching each project with a focused mission We present a five step planning process beginning with the identification of opportunities and resulting in a mission statement for the project team The Product Planning Process The product plan identifies the portfolio of products to be developed by the organization and the timing of their introduction to the market The planning process considers product development opportunities identified by many sources including suggestions from marketing research customers current product development teams and benchmarking of competitors From among these opportunities a portfolio of projects is chosen timing Platforms Derivatives Improvements Fundamentally New Product Planning 55 Legend Lakes Project Product L Net Q 0 595 6010 9 392 393 1996 I 1997 I 1998 I 1999 I 2000 I EXHIBIT 4 2 The product plan identifies the portfolio of projects to be pursued by the development organization This plan divides projects into four categories new platforms derivatives of existing platforms product improvements and fundamentally new products projects is outlined and resources are allocated Exhibit 4 2 is an example of a product plan listing products to be developed and indicating the time frame for each The product plan is regularly updated to reflect changes in the competitive environment changes in technology and information on the success of existing products Product plans are developed with the company s goals capabilities constraints and competitive environment in mind Product planning decisions generally involve the senior management of the organization and may take place only annually or a few times each year Some organizations have a director of planning who manages this process Organizations that do not carefully plan the portfolio of development projects to pursue are often plagued with inefficiencies such as Inadequate coverage of target markets with competitive products 0 Poor timing of market introductions of products Mismatches between aggregate development capacity and the number of projects pursued Poor distribution of resources with some projects overstaffed and others understaffed Initiation and subsequent cancellation of ill conceived projects 0 Frequent changes in the directions of projects Four Types of Product Development Projects Product development projects can be classified as four types New product platforms This type of project involves a major development effort to create a new family of products based on a new common platform The new product family would address familiar markets and product categories The Xerox Lakes project aimed at the development of a new digital copier platform is an example of this type of project 56 Chapter 4 Derivatives of existing product platforms These projects extend an existing product platform to better address familiar markets with one or more new products To develop a new copier based on an existing light lens not digital product platform would be an example of this type of project Incremental improvements to existing products These projects may only involve adding or modifying some features of existing products in order to keep the product line current and competitive A slight change to remedy minor flaws in an existing copier product would be an example of this type of Fundamentally new products These projects involve radically different product or production technologies and may help to address new and unfamiliar markets Such projects inherently involve more risk however the long term success of the enterprise may depend on what is learned through these important projects The first digital copier Xerox developed is an example of this type of project The Process Exhibit 4 3 illustrates the steps in the product planning process First multiple opportunities are prioritized and a set of promising projects is selected Resources are allocated to these projects and they are scheduled These planning activities focus on a portfolio of opportunities and potential projects and are sometimes referred to as portfolio management aggregate product planning product line planning or product management Once projects have been selected and resources allocated a mission statement is developed for each project The formulation of a product plan and the development of a mission statement therefore precede the actual product development process Although we show the planning process as essentially linear the activities of selecting promising projects and allocating resources are inherently iterative The realities of schedules and budgets often force a reassessment of priorities and further refinement and culling of potential projects The product plan is therefore reevaluated frequently and should be modified based on the latest information from development teams research laboratories production marketing and service organizations People involved later in the process are often the first to realize that something about the overall plan or a project s mission is inconsistent infeasible or out of date The ability to adjust the product plan over time is vital to the long term success of the enterprise Multiple Projects Evaluate and Allocate Complete Product Prioritize and Project Projects Product Planning Mission Projects Plan Statements Identify Opportunities Development Process EXHIBIT 4 3 The product planning process These activities address a portfolio of product development projects resulting in a product plan and for each selected project a mission statement Product Planning 57 To develop a product plan and project mission statements we suggest a five step process Identify opportunities Evaluate and prioritize projects Allocate resources and plan timing Complete project planning 9 Reflect on the results and the process Step 1 Identify Opportunities The planning process begins with the identification of product development opportunities Such opportunities may involve any of the four types of projects defined above This step can be thought of as the opportunity funnel because it brings together inputs from across the enterprise Opportunities may be collected passively but we also recommend that the firm explicitly attempt to generate opportunities Chapter 3 Opportunity Identification provides a process for generating recognizing and evaluating opportunities When employed actively the opportunity funnel collects ideas continuously and new product opportunities may arise at any time As a way of tracking sorting and refining these opportunities we recommend that each promising opportunity be described in a short coherent statement and that this information be collected in a database Several Web based idea management systems are available for gathering and storing information on opportunities although a simple list in a spreadsheet may be sufficient At Xerox many opportunities had been gathered and discussed Some were simple enhancements to existing products and others were proposals for products based on entirely new technologies Following are some examples of opportunity statements similar to those proposed at Xerox Create a document distribution system in which a networked printing device resides on each office worker s desk and automatically delivers mail and other documents Create document delivery software that allows the digital delivery and storage of most documents via a worker s personal computer This opportunity statement eventually became the Lakes project Develop a new black and white B W digital document center platform for the office market including scanning storage fax distribution and printing capabilities Step 2 Evaluate and Prioritize Projects If managed actively the opportunity funnel can collect hundreds or even thousands of opportunities during a year Some of these opportunities do not make sense in the context of the firm s other activities and in most cases there are simply too many opportunities for the firm to pursue at once The second step in the product Chapter 4 process is therefore to select the most promising projects to pursue Four basic perspectives are useful in evaluating and prioritizing opportunities for new products in existing product categories competitive strategy market segmentation technological trajectories and product platforms After discussing these four perspectives we then discuss evaluating opportunities for fundamentally new products and how to balance the portfolio of projects Competitive Strategy An organization s competitive strategy defines a basic approach to markets and products with respect to competitors The choice of which opportunities to pursue can be guided by this strategy Most firms devote much discussion at senior management levels to their strategic competencies and the ways in which they aim to compete Several strategies are possible such as Technology leadership To implement this strategy the firm places great emphasis on basic research and development of new technologies and on the deployment of these technologies through product development Cost leadership This strategy requires the firm to compete on production efficiency either through economies of scale use of superior manufacturing methods low cost labor or better management of the production system Design for manufacturing methods see Chapter 11 are therefore emphasized in the product and process development activities under this strategy Customer focus To follow this strategy the firm works closely with new and existing customers to assess their changing needs and preferences Carefully designed product platforms facilitate the rapid development of derivative products with new features or functions of interest to customers This strategy may result in a broad product line featuring high product variety in order to address the needs of heterogeneous customer segments Imitative This strategy involves closely following trends in the market allowing competitors to explore which new products are successful for each segment When viable opportunities have been identified the firm quickly launches new products to imitate the successful competitors A fast development process is essential to effectively implement this strategy At Xerox strategic discussions centered around how the company would participate in the digital revolution of the office associated with growth of the Internet Xerox believed that the Internet would enable a paradigm shift in business practices from one of print and then distribute to one of distribute and then print The Lakes project would need to support this corporate vision Market Segmentation Customers can be usefully thought of as belonging to distinct market segments Dividing a market into segments allows the firm to consider the actions of competitors and the strength of the firm s existing products with respect to each group of customers By mapping competitors products and the firm s Market Segments Personal Product Planning 59 Lakes Project i i 40 ppm r Extensions i 1 a 25 ppm FEE Erin q I I Legend Xerox product 30 ppm 4 ppm product

introduction products onto segments the firm can assess which product opportunities best address weaknesses in its own product line and which exploit weaknesses in the offerings of competitors Exhibit 4 4 shows a product segment map of this type for some Xerox products in which markets are segmented according to the number of users sharing office equipment Technological Trajectories In technology intensive businesses a key product planning decision is when to adopt a new basic technology in a product line For example in the document business the key technological issue at the turn of the century was the shift to digital image processing and printing The product planning decision was when to develop digital products as opposed to developing another product based on light lens technology Technology S curves are a conceptual tool to help think about such decisions The technology S curve displays the performance of the products in a product category over time usually with respect to a single performance variable such as resolution speed or reliability The S curve illustrates a basic but important concept Technologies evolve from initial emergence when performance is relatively low through rapid growth in performance based on experience and finally approach maturity where some Chapter 4 Copier Product Performance A Digital Technology Light Lens Technology I Today Time EXHIBIT 4 5 This technology S curve illustrates that Xerox believed digital copier technologies were just emerging and would improve product performance in the coming years Xerox believed that it could develop a full featured digital copier in the near future with performance exceeding that of light lens copiers technological limit is reached and the technology may become obsolete The S shaped trajectory captures this general dynamic as shown in Exhibit 4 5 The horizontal axis may be cumulative research and development effort or time the vertical axis may be a performance cost ratio or any important performance dimension While S curves characterize technological change remarkably well in a wide variety of industries it is often difficult to predict the future trajectory of the performance curve how near or far is the ultimate performance limit Product Platform Planning The product platform is the set of assets shared across a set of products Components and are often the most important of these assets An effective platform can allow a variety of derivative products to be created more rapidly and easily with each product providing the features and functions desired by a particular market segment See Chapter 10 Product Architecture for more discussion of the underlying architecture enabling the product platform and for a platform planning method Since platform development projects can take from 2 to 10 times as much time and money as derivative product development projects a firm cannot afford to make every project a new platform Exhibit 4 6 illustrates the leverage of an effective product platform The critical strategic decision at this stage is whether a project will develop a derivative product from an existing platform or develop an entirely new platform and Technology Development Platform Product Development Derivative Product Development Product Planning 61 V v Legend Platform A Platform B Project Product Release Time EXHIBIT 4 6 A platform development project creates the architecture of a family of products Derivative products may be included in the initial platform development effort Platform A or derivative products may follow

technique for coordinating technology development with product planning is the technology A technology is a way to represent the expected availability and future use of various technologies relevant to the product being considered This method has been used by Motorola Xerox and other leaders in fast moving high technology industries The method is particularly useful for planning products in which the critical functional elements are well known in advance To create a technology multiple generations of technologies are labeled and arranged along a time line as shown in Exhibit 4 7 The technology can be augmented with the timing of projects and projects that would utilize these technological developments This is sometimes then called a product technology The result is a diagram showing a product s key functional elements and the sequence of technologies expected to implement these elements over a given period of time Technology can serve as a planning tool to create a joint strategy between technology development and product development Evaluating Fundamentally New Product Opportunities In addition to new versions of products in existing product categories the firm faces many opportunities in either new markets or fundamentally new technologies While investing scarce resources in the development of products using new technologies or for new markets is quite risky some such investments are necessary to Chapter 4 Functional Elements Technologies Photo Cylindrical 3 Pitch Belt n Pitch Belt receptor Drum j K Scanner Array Full Width Linear Array Layout w Optical without

in each product For the Lakes platform Xerox selected technologies for critical functions that could be extended to the higher speeds and color capability required of its derivative products rejuvenate the product portfolio Christensen 1997 Some criteria for evaluating fundamentally new product opportunities include 0 Market size units year average price Market growth rate percent per year Competitive intensity number of competitors and their strengths Depth of the firm s existing knowledge of the market Depth of the firm s existing knowledge of the technology Fit with the firm s other products Fit with the firm s capabilities Research and Product Planning 63 0 Potential for patents trade secrets or other barriers to competition Existence of a product champion within the firm While these criteria are particularly useful in evaluating fundamentally new product opportunities they also apply generally to evaluating any product opportunity These criteria can be used in a simple screening matrix to evaluate the overall attractiveness and types of risk for any given opportunity Chapter 3 Opportunity Identification includes the Real it analysis for opportunities an example of criteria based evaluation Chapter 8 Concept Selection describes screening matrices for selecting product concepts but this method is directly applicable to selecting product opportunities as well Balancing the Portfolio There are many methods to help managers manage an organization s portfolio of development projects Several of these methods involve mapping the portfolio along useful dimensions so that managers may consider the strategic implications of their planning decisions Cooper et 2001 describe mapping approaches involving dimensions such as technical risk financial return market attractiveness and the like One particularly useful mapping suggested by Wheelwright and Clark 1992 plots the portfolio of projects along two specific dimensions the extent to which the project involves a change in the product line and the extent to which the project involves a change in production processes Exhibit 4 8 Extent of Production Process Changes Technology New Next Single Tuning

Product process change matrix The size of the circles indicates the relative cost of the development projects 64 Chapter 4 illustrates this mapping called a product process change matrix This perspective can be useful to illuminate imbalances in the portfolio of projects under consideration and in assessing the consistency between a portfolio of projects and the competitive strategy For example a firm may discover that it has identified essentially no breakthrough opportunities or that it has no projects aimed at incremental improvements to existing products There are no general procedures for deciding exactly what the portfolio should look like However the firm s choice of competitive strategy should affect the shape of the product development portfolio For example a firm pursuing a low cost strategy would expect the portfolio to contain more production process improvement projects Firms following a strategy requiring high product variety would need to develop many derivative products based upon existing platforms Firms implementing a strategy based on technological superiority may need to have a portfolio including more technology development and breakthrough projects in anticipation that not all of these risky projects will result in marketable new products Note that planning research and technology development activities is closely coupled to but generally outside the purview of the product planning process Step 3 Allocate Resources and Plan Timing It is likely that the firm cannot afford to invest in every product development opportunity in its desired balanced portfolio of As timing and resource allocation are determined for the most promising projects too many projects will invariably compete for too few resources As a result the attempt to assign resources and plan timing always results in a return to the prior evaluation and step to prune the set of to be pursued Resource Allocation Many organizations take on too many projects without regard for the limited availability of development resources As a result skilled engineers and managers are assigned to more and more projects productivity drops off dramatically projects take longer to complete products become late to the market and profits are lower Aggregate planning helps an organization make efficient use of its resources by pursuing only those projects that can reasonably be completed with the budgeted resources The Lakes project was only one of many projects proposed at Xerox However since Lakes involved the development of an entirely new platform this project was substantially larger than the other projects being considered at the time Any feasible portfolio of projects would be dominated by the resource demands of the Lakes platform development effort In fact for the managers at Xerox to find the resources necessary to execute Lakes many other projects had to be eliminated or postponed until engineers were finished working on Lakes Estimating the resources required for each of the projects in the plan by month quarter or year forces the organization to face the realities of finite resources In most cases the primary resource to be managed is the effort of the development staff usually expressed in person hours or person months Other critical resources may also require careful planning such as model shop facilities rapid prototyping equipment pilot production lines testing facilities and so on Estimates of required resources in each period can be compared with available resources to compute an overall capacity utilization ratio demand capacity as well as utilizations by resource types as shown in Exhibit 4 9 Where utilization exceeds 100 percent there are not sufficient resources to execute all 1

4 9 Aggregate resource planning can be achieved using a simple spreadsheet method based on estimates of resource demands over time This example spreadsheet uses units of person years although smaller time units quarters or months are commonly used in practice The associated chart highlights Where capacity is insufficient to handle all of the projects 99 19712004466 Chapter 4 the projects in the plan on schedule In fact to allow for contingencies and to enable responsiveness planned capacity utilization may be below 100 percent In the aggregate planning process an organization may find that it is in danger of resources often by as much as 100 percent or more according to Wheelwright and Clark 1992 Therefore the organization must decide in the planning stage which projects are most important to the success of the firm and pursue those with adequate resources Other projects may need to be eliminated from the plan or shifted in time Project Timing Determining the timing and sequence of projects sometimes called pipeline management must consider a number of factors including Timing of product introductions Generally the sooner a product is brought to market the better However launching a product before it is of adequate quality can damage the reputation of the firm Technology readiness The robustness of the underlying technologies plays a critical role in the planning process A proven robust technology can be integrated into products much more quickly and reliably Market readiness The sequence of product introductions determines whether early adopters buy the low end product and may trade up or whether they buy the high end product offered at a high initial price Releasing improvements too quickly can frustrate customers who want to keep up on the other hand releasing new products too slowly risks lagging behind competitors Competition The anticipated release of competing products may accelerate the timing of development projects The Product Plan The set of projects approved by the planning process sequenced in time becomes the product plan as shown earlier in Exhibit 4 2 The plan may include a mix of fundamentally new products platform projects and derivative projects of varying size Product plans are updated on a periodic basis perhaps quarterly or annually as part of the firm s strategic planning activity Step 4 Complete Planning Once the project has been approved but before substantial resources are applied a project planning activity takes place This activity involves a small cross functional team of people often known as the core team The Lakes core team consisted of approximately 30 people representing a wide range of technical expertise marketing manufacturing and service functions At this point the earlier opportunity statement may be rewritten as a product vision statement The Lakes concept team began with the following product vision statement Develop a networked mid range digital platform for imaging marking and finishing The objective defined by a product vision statement may be very general It may not say which specific new technologies should be used nor does it necessarily specify the goals and constraints of functions such as production and service operations In 4 1 0 Mission statement for the Lakes project This document summarizes the direction to be followed by the product development team Many more details are appended to this mission statement including the environmental goals service objectives and specific technologies identified for use in the Lakes platform Product Planning

resellers to provide clear guidance for the product development organization generally the team formulates a more detailed definition of the target market and of the assumptions under which the development team will operate These decisions are captured in a mission statement a summary of which is illustrated in Exhibit 4 10 Mission Statements The mission statement may include some or all of the following information Brief one sentence description of the product This description identifies the basic function of the product but avoids implying a specific product concept It may in fact be the product vision statement Benefit proposition This element of the mission statement articulates the critical few reasons a customer would buy the product To some extent this is a hypothesis which will be validated during the concept development process Key business goals In addition to the project goals that support the corporate strategy these goals generally include goals for time cost and quality e g timing of the product introduction desired financial performance market share targets 68 Chapter 4 Target market s for the product There may be several target markets for the product This part of the mission statement identifies the primary market as well as any secondary markets that should be considered in the development effort Assumptions and constraints that guide the development effort Assumptions must be made carefully although they restrict the range of possible product concepts they help to maintain a manageable project scope Information may be attached to the mission statement to document decisions about assumptions and constraints Stakeholders One way to ensure that many of the subtle development issues are addressed is to explicitly list all of the product s stakeholders that is all of the groups of people who are affected by the product s success or failure The stakeholder list begins with the end user the ultimate external customer and the external customer who makes the buying decision about the product Stakeholders also include the customers of the product who reside within the firm such as the sales force the service organization and the production departments The list of stakeholders serves as a reminder for the team to consider the needs of everyone who will be influenced by the product Assumptions and Constraints In creating the mission statement the team considers the strategies of several functional areas within the firm Of the many possible functional strategies to consider the manufacturing service and environmental strategies had the largest influence on the Lakes project In fact these strategies guided the core technical developments of the product One could reasonably ask why manufacturing service and environmental strategies for example should be part of the mission statement for a new product An alternative view is that decisions about these issues should arise from the customer needs for the new product and should not be determined in advance First for extremely complex projects like Lakes the design of the manufacturing system is a project of similar magnitude to the design of the product itself As a result the manufacturing facilities involved in the product need to be identified very early in the process Second some product requirements may not be derived strictly from customer needs For example most customers will not directly express a need for low environmental impact However Xerox chose to adopt a corporate policy of environmentally responsible design In such cases the mission statement should reflect such corporate objectives and constraints Following are some of the issues that Xerox considered in establishing assumptions and constraints for the Lakes project Manufacturing Even at this very preliminary stage it is important to consider the capabilities capacities and constraints of the manufacturing operations A broad array of questions may be relevant including Which internal production facilities might be used to manufacture and assemble the product What key suppliers should be involved in the development and when Are the existing production systems capable of producing the new technologies that have been identified for the product For Lakes Xerox assumed that input devices would be manufactured at production sites in Canada output devices in Brazil and the digital image processing engine in both the United States and Europe Service In a business where customer service and service revenue are critical to the success of the firm it is necessary to also state strategic goals for levels of Planning 69 quality Efforts to improve service include a strategic commitment to designing products that contain few parts which can be serviced quickly For Lakes serviceability goals included reducing both the number of field replaceable modules required to fully service the machine and the time to install them by an order of magnitude Environment Many corporations today are developing new products with environmental sustainability in mind The Lakes concept team adopted Xerox s first zero to landfill policy an aggressive goal even for a leader in environmental design practices such as Xerox The stated goal was that no components from a Lakes product should ever go to a landfill All components would be either or recyclable or both No parts should be disposed of by customers The Lakes environmental design strategy also included an energy efficiency goal to be the most efficient machine in its class Staffing and Other Project Planning Activities The project planning activity also generally addresses project staffing and leadership This may involve getting key members of the development staff to sign up for a new project that is to agree to commit to leading the development of the product or of a critical element of the product Budgets are also generally established during project planning For fundamentally new products budgets and staffing plans will be for the concept development phase of development only This is because the details of the project are highly uncertain until the basic concept for the new product has been established More detailed planning will occur when and if the concept is developed further Step 5 Reflect on the Results and the Process In this final step of the planning and strategy process the team should ask several questions to assess the quality of both the process and the results Some suggested questions are 0 Is the opportunity funnel collecting an exciting and diverse set of product opportunities Does the product plan support the competitive strategy of the firm Does the product plan address the most important current opportunities facing the firm Are the total resources allocated to product development sufficient to pursue the firm s competitive strategy Have creative ways of leveraging finite resources been considered such as the use of product platforms joint ventures and partnerships with suppliers Does the core team accept the challenges of the resulting mission statement 0 Are the elements of the mission statement consistent 0 Are the assumptions listed in the mission statement really necessary or is the project Will the development team have the freedom to develop the best possible product 0 How can the product planning process be improved Because the mission statement is the to the development team a reality check must be performed before proceeding with the development process This early stage is the time to remedy known flaws lest they become more severe and expensive as the development process progresses 70 Chapter 4 This chapter explains the product planning method as a stepwise process largely for simplicity of the presentation However reflection and criticism of consistency and fit should be an ongoing process Steps in the process can and should be executed simultaneously to make sure that the many plans and decisions are consistent with one another and with the goals capabilities and constraints of the firm Summary Product planning is a periodic process that considers the portfolio of product development projects to be executed Product planning involves a five step process 1 Identify opportunities 2 Evaluate and prioritize projects 3 Allocate resources and plan timing 4 Complete planning 5 Reflect on the results and the process The opportunity funnel collects possibilities for new product platforms enhancements and fundamentally new products from several sources within and outside the firm Potential product development projects are evaluated based on the organization s competitive strategy technological trajectories and product platform plans A balanced portfolio of development projects may include investments in breakthrough products new platforms derivatives and current product support Aggregate planning ensures that selected projects have adequate resources for successful completion A mission statement for each product development project documents the product description benefit proposition business goals target markets critical assumptions and the product s

FIVE Identifying Customer Needs Photo by Stuart Cohen EXHIBIT 5 1 Existing products used to drive screws manual screwdrivers cordless screwdriver screw gun cordless drill with driver bit 7374 Chapter 5 Mission Statement Identify Customer Needs A successful hand tool manufacturer was exploring the growing market for power tools After performing initial research the firm decided to enter the market with a cordless screwdriver Exhibit 5 1 shows several existing products used to drive screws After some initial concept work the manufacturer s development team fabricated and field tested several prototypes The results were discouraging Although some of the products were liked better than others each one had some feature that customers objected to in one way or another The results were quite mystifying since the company had been successful in related consumer products for years After much discussion the team decided that its process for identifying customer needs was inadequate This chapter presents a method for comprehensively identifying a set of customer needs The goals of the method are to 0 Ensure that the product is focused on customer needs 0 Identify latent or hidden needs as well as explicit needs Provide a fact base for justifying the product specifications 0 Create an archival record of the needs activity of the development process 0 Ensure that no critical customer need is missed or forgotten Develop a common understanding of customer needs among members of the development team The philosophy behind the method is to create a high quality information channel that runs directly between customers in the target market and the developers of the product This philosophy is built on the premise that those who directly control the details of the product including the engineers and industrial designers must interact with customers and experience the use environment of the product Without this direct experience technical trade offs are not likely to be made correctly innovative solutions to customer needs may never be discovered and the development team may never develop a deep commitment to meeting customer needs The process of identifying customer needs is an integral part of the larger product development process and is most closely related to concept generation concept selection competitive benchmarking and the establishment of product specifications The activity is shown in Exhibit 5 2 in relation to these other front end product development activities which collectively can be thought of as the concept development phase The concept development process illustrated in Exhibit 5 2 implies a distinction between customer needs and product specifications This distinction is subtle but important 1 1 1 1 1 Establish Generate Select Test Set Plan Plan Target Product Product Product Final Downstream Specifications Concepts Concept s Concept s Specifications Development Development Perform Economic Analysis Benchmark Competitive Products Build Models and Prototypes EXHIBIT 5 2 The customer needs activity in relation to other concept development activities Identifying Customer Needs 75 Needs are largely independent of any particular product we might develop they are not specific to the concept we eventually choose to pursue A team should be able to identify customer needs without knowing if or how it will eventually address those needs On the other hand specifications do depend on the concept we select The specifications for the product we finally choose to develop will depend on what is technically and economically feasible and on what our competitors offer in the marketplace as well as on customer needs See Chapter 6 Product Specifications for a more detailed discussion of this distinction Also note that we choose to use the word need to label any attribute of a potential product that is desired by the customer we do not distinguish here between a want and a need Other terms used in industrial practice to refer to customer needs include customer attributes and customer requirements Identifying customer needs is itself a process for which we present a five step method We believe that a little structure goes a long way in facilitating effective product development practices and we hope and expect that this method will be viewed by those who employ it not as a rigid process but rather as a starting point for continuous improvement and refinement The five steps are 1 Gather raw data from customers 2 Interpret the raw data in terms of customer needs 3 Organize the needs into a hierarchy of primary secondary and if necessary tertiary needs 4 Establish the relative importance of the needs 5 Reflect on the results and the process We treat each of the five steps in turn and illustrate the key points with the cordless screwdriver example We chose the screwdriver because it is simple enough that the method is not hidden by the complexity of the example However note that the same method with minor adaptation has been successfully applied to hundreds of products ranging from kitchen utensils costing less than 10 to machine tools costing hundreds of thousands of dollars Before beginning the development project the firm typically specifies a particular market opportunity and lays out the broad constraints and objectives for the project This information is frequently formalized as a mission statement also sometimes called a charter or a design brief The mission statement specifies which direction to go in but generally does not specify a precise destination or a particular way to proceed The mission statement is the result of the product planning activities described in Chapter 4 Product Planning The mission statement for the cordless screwdriver is shown in Exhibit 5 3 The cordless screwdriver category of products is already relatively well developed Such products are particularly well suited to a structured process for gathering customer needs One could reasonably ask whether a structured method is effective for completely new categories of products with which customers have no experience Satisfying needs is just as important in revolutionary products as in incremental products A necessary condition for product success is that a product offer perceived benefits to the customer Products offer benefits when they satisfy needs This is true whether the product is an incremental variation on an existing product or whether it is a completely new product based on a revolutionary invention Developing an entirely new category of product is a risky undertaking and to some extent the only real indication of whether customer needs Chapter 5 EXHIBIT 5 3 Mission statement for the cordless screwdriver Mission Statement Screwdriver Project

assisted Nickel metal hydride rechargeable battery technology Stakeholders Reta Sales force Service center department been identified correctly is whether customers like the team s first prototypes Nevertheless in our opinion a structured method for gathering data from customers remains useful and can lower the inherent risk in developing a radically new product Whether or not customers are able to fully articulate their latent needs interaction with customers in the target market will help the development team build a personal understanding of the user s environment and point of view This information is always useful even if it does not result in the identification of every need the new product will address Step 1 Gather Raw Data from Customers Consistent with our basic philosophy of creating a high quality information channel directly from the customer gathering data involves contact with customers and experience with the use environment of the product Three methods are commonly used 1 Interviews One or more development team members discusses needs with a single customer Interviews are usually conducted in the customer s environment and typically last one to two hours 2 Focus groups A moderator facilitates a two hour discussion with a group of 8 to 12 customers Focus groups are typically conducted in a special room equipped with a two way mirror allowing several members of the development team to observe the group In most cases the moderator is a professional market researcher but a member of the development team sometimes moderates The proceedings are usually video recorded Participants are usually paid a modest fee 50 to 100 each for their attendance The total cost of a focus group including rental of the room participant fees video recording and refreshments is about 5 000 In most U S cities firms that recruit participants moderate focus groups and or rent facilities are listed in directories under Market Research EXHIBIT 5 4 Comparison of the percentages of customer needs that are revealed for focus groups and interviews as a function of the number of sessions Note that a focus group lasts two hours while an interview lasts one hour Source Griffin and Hauser 1993 Identifying Customer Needs 77 100 80 u 9 5 c a 3 60 U u a a Z 6 40 2 O One on One Interview 1 hour g Focus Group 2 hours a 20 I I I I I I I I I I 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Number of Interviews or Groups 3 Observing the product in use Watching customers use an existing product or perform a task for which a new product is intended can reveal important details about customer needs For example a customer painting a house may use a screwdriver to open paint cans in addition to driving screws Observation may be completely passive without any direct interaction with the customer or may involve working side by side with a customer allowing members of the development team to develop firsthand experience using the product Ideally team members observe the product in the actual use environment Gamble for example observes thousands of customers every year in their homes or workplaces to better understand their needs For some products such as do it yourself tools actually using the products is simple and natural for others such as surgical instruments the team may have to use the products on surrogate tasks e g cutting fruit instead of human tissue when developing a new scalpel Some practitioners also rely on written surveys for gathering raw data While a survey is quite useful later in the process we cannot recommend this approach for initial efforts to identify customer needs text based surveys simply do not provide enough information about the use environment of the product and they are generally ineffective in revealing unanticipated needs Research by Griffin and Hauser shows that one 2 hour focus group reveals about the same number of needs as two l hour interviews Griffin and Hauser 1993 See Exhibit 5 4 Because interviews are usually less costly per hour than focus groups and because an interview often allows the product development team to experience the use environment of the product we recommend that interviews be the primary data collection method Interviews may be supplemented with one or two focus groups as a way to allow top management to observe a group of customers or as a mechanism for sharing a common customer experience via video with the members of a larger team Some practitioners believe that for certain products and customer groups the interactions among the participants of focus groups can elicit more varied needs than are revealed through interviews although this belief is not strongly supported by research findings 78 Chapter 5 Choosing Customers Griffin and Hauser also addressed the question of how many customers to interview in order to reveal most of the customer needs In one study they estimated that 90 percent of the customer needs for picnic coolers were revealed after 30 interviews In another study they estimated that 98 percent of the customer needs for a piece of office equipment were revealed after 25 hours of data collection in both focus groups and interviews As a practical guideline for most products conducting fewer than 10 interviews is probably inadequate and 50 interviews are probably too many However interviews can be conducted sequentially and the process can be terminated when no new needs are revealed by additional interviews These guidelines apply to cases in which the development team is addressing a single market segment If the team wishes to gather customer needs from multiple distinct segments then the team may need to conduct 10 or more interviews in each segment Concept development teams consisting of more than 10 people usually collect data from plenty of customers simply by involving much of the team in the process For example if a person team is divided into five pairs and each pair conducts 6 interviews the team conducts 30 interviews in total Needs can be identified more efficiently by interviewing lead users and or extreme users According to lead users are customers who experience needs months or years ahead of the majority of the market and stand to benefit substantially from product innovations 1988 These customers are particularly useful sources of data for two reasons 1 they are often able to articulate their emerging needs because they have had to struggle with the inadequacies of existing products and 2 they may have already invented solutions to meet their needs By focusing a portion of the data collection efforts on lead users the team may be able to identify needs that although explicit for lead users are still latent for the majority of the market Developing products to meet these latent needs allows a firm to anticipate trends and to leapfrog competitive products Extreme users are those who use the product in unusual ways or who have special needs For example extreme users of the screwdriver might be people who have limited vision or dexterity or those who use the tool professionally every day Extreme users can help the team identify needs that may be felt less acutely by the mainstream market but are nevertheless important opportunities for competitive advantage For example entrepreneur Sam Farber created the original Good Grips vegetable peeler in response to the needs of his wife who suffered from arthritis Her extreme needs proved to be a reflection of the latent need for more ergonomic kitchen tools among mainstream users The choice of which customers to interview is complicated when several different groups of people can be considered the customer For many products one person the buyer makes the buying decision and another person the user actually uses the product A good approach is to gather data from the end user of the product in all situations and in cases where other types of customers and stakeholders are clearly important to gather data from these people as well A customer selection matrix is useful for planning exploration of both market and customer variety suggests that market segments be listed on the left side of the matrix while the different types of customers are listed across the top et 1997 as shown in Exhibit 5 5 The number of intended customer contacts is entered in each cell to indicate the depth of coverage For industrial and commercial products actually locating customers is usually a matter of making telephone calls or sending e mail In developing such products within 5 5 Customer selection matrix for the cordless screwdriver project Identifying Customer Needs 79 Retailer or Service Lead Users Users Sales Outlet Centers Homeowner O 5 occasional use 2 H person 3 3 frequent use Professional 3 2 2 heavy duty use existing firm a field sales force can often provide names of customers although the team must be careful about biasing the selection of customers toward those with allegiances to a particular manufacturer The Web or a telephone directory can be used to identify names of some types of customers for some classes of products e g building contractors or insurance agents For products that are integral to a customer s job getting someone to agree to an interview is usually simple these customers are eager to discuss their needs For consumer products customers can also be located by making telephone calls or e mail inquiries However arranging a set of interviews for consumer products generally requires more inquiries than for industrial or commercial products because the benefit of participating in an interview is less direct for these customers The Art of Eliciting Customer Needs Data The techniques we present here are aimed primarily at interviewing end users but these methods do apply to all of the three data gathering modes and to all types of stakeholders The basic approach is to be receptive to information provided by customers and to avoid confrontations or defensive posturing Gathering needs data is very different from a sales call the goal is to elicit an honest expression of needs not to convince a customer of what he or she needs In most cases customer interactions will be verbal interviewers ask questions and the customer responds A prepared interview guide is valuable for structuring this Some helpful questions and prompts for use after the interviewers introduce themselves and explain the purpose of the interview are When and why do you use this type of product 0 Walk us through atypical session using the product What do you like about the existing products What do you dislike about the existing products What issues do you consider when purchasing the product 0 What improvements would you make to the product Here are some general hints for effective interaction with customers with the flow If the customer is providing useful information do not worry about conforming to the interview guide The goal is to gather important data on customer needs not to complete the interview guide in the allotted time 80 Chapter 5 Use visual stimuli and props Bring a collection of existing and competitors products or even products that are tangentially related to the product under development At the end of a session the interviewers might even show some preliminary product concepts to get customers early reactions to various approaches Suppress preconceived hypotheses about the product technology Frequently customers will make assumptions about the product concept they expect would meet their needs In these situations the interviewers should avoid biasing the discussion with assumptions about how the product will eventually be designed or produced When customers mention specific technologies or product features the interviewer should probe for the underlying need the customer believes the suggested solution would satisfy Have the customer demonstrate the product and or typical tasks related to the product If the interview is conducted in the use environment a demonstration is usually convenient and invariably reveals new information Be alert for surprises and the expression of latent needs If a customer mentions something surprising pursue the lead with follow up questions Frequently an unexpected line of questioning will reveal latent needs important dimensions of the customers needs that are neither fulfilled nor commonly articulated and understood Watch for nonverbal information The process described in the chapter is aimed at developing better physical products Unfortunately words are not always the best way to communicate needs related to the physical world This is particularly true of needs involving the human dimensions of the product such as comfort image or style The development team must be constantly aware of the nonverbal messages provided by customers What are their facial expressions How do they hold competitors products Note that many of our suggested questions and guidelines assume that the customer has some familiarity with products similar to the new product under development This is almost always true For example even before the first cordless screwdriver became available people installed fasteners Developing an understanding of customer needs as they relate to the general fastening task would still have been beneficial in developing the first cordless tool Similarly understanding the needs of customers using other types of cordless appliances such as electric razors would also have been useful We can think of no product so revolutionary that there would be no analogous products or tasks from which the development team could learn However in gathering needs relating to truly revolutionary products with which customers have no experience the interview questions should be focused on the task or situation in which the new product will be applied rather than on the product itself Documenting Interactions with Customers Four methods are commonly used for documenting interactions with customers 1 Audio recording Making an audio recording of the interview is very easy Unfortunately transcribing the recording into text is very time consuming and hiring someone to do it can be expensive Also audio recording has the disadvantage of being intimidating to some customers 2 Notes Handwritten notes are the most common method of documenting an interview Designating one person as the primary allows the other person to concentrate on effective questioning The should strive to capture some of the Customer Needs 81 of every customer statement verbatim These notes if transcribed immediately after the interview can be used to create a description of the interview that is very close to an actual transcript This debriefing immediately after the interview also facilitates sharing of insights between the interviewers 3 Video recording Video recording is almost always used to document a focus group session It is also very useful for documenting observations of the customer in the use environment and or using existing products The video recording is useful for bringing new team members up to speed and is also useful as raw material for presentations to upper management Multiple viewings of video recordings of customers in action often facilitate the identification of latent customer needs Video recording is also useful for capturing many aspects of the end user s environment 4 Still photography Taking photographs provides many of the benefits of video recording but is usually less intrusive and therefore easier to do while observing customers in the field Additional advantages of still photography are ease of display of the photos excellent image quality and readily available equipment The primary disadvantage is the relative inability to record dynamic information The final result of the data gathering phase of the process is a set of raw data usually in the form of customer statements but frequently supplemented by video recordings or photographs A data template implemented in a spreadsheet is useful for organizing these raw data Exhibit 5 6 is an example of a portion of such a template We recommend that the template be filled in as soon as possible after the interaction with the customer and edited by the other development team members present during the interaction The first column in the main body of the template indicates the question or prompt that elicited the customer data The second column is a list of verbatim statements the customer made or an observation of a customer action from a video recording or from direct observation The third column contains the customer needs implied by the raw data Some emphasis should be placed on investigating clues that may identify potential latent needs Such clues may be in the form of remarks less serious suggestions frustrations nonverbal information or observations and descriptions of the use environment The symbol I is used in Exhibit 5 6 to flag potential latent needs Techniques for interpreting the raw data in terms of customer needs are given in the next section The final task in step 1 is to write thank you notes to the customers involved in the process Invariably the team will need to solicit further customer information so developing and maintaining a good rapport with a set of users is important Step 2 Interpret Raw Data in Terms of Customer Needs Customer needs are expressed as written statements and are the result of interpreting the need underlying the raw data gathered from the customers Each statement or observation as listed in the second column of the data template may be translated into any number of customer needs Griffin and Hauser found that multiple analysts may translate the same interview notes into different needs so it is useful to have more than one team member conducting the translation process Below we provide five guidelines for writing need statements The first two guidelines are fundamental and are critical to effective translation the remaining three guidelines ensure consistency of phrasing and style across all team members Exhibit 5 7 provides examples to illustrate each guideline 82 Chapter 5 Customer Address Telephone Willing to do follow up Bill Esposito 100 Memorial Drive Cambridge MA 02139 617 864 1274 Yes Date s Currently uses Type of user

and interpreted needs SD is an abbreviation for screwdriver Note that this template represents a partial list from a single interview A typical interview session may elicit more than 50 customer statements and interpreted needs Express the need in terms of What the product has to do not in terms of how it might do it Customers often express their preferences by describing a solution concept or an implementation approach however the need statement should be expressed in terms independent of a particular technological solution Express the need as specifically as the raw data Needs can be expressed at many levels of detail To avoid loss of information express the need at the same level of detail as the raw data Use positive not negative phrasing Subsequent translation of a need into a product specification is easier if the need is expressed as a positive statement This is not a rigid guideline because sometimes positive phrasing is difficult and awkward For example one of the need statements in Exhibit 5 6 is the screwdriver does not strip screw heads This need is more naturally expressed in a negative form Identifying Customer Needs 83 Guideline What not how Specificity Positive not negative An attribute of the product Avoid must and should Customer Statement Why don t you put protective shields around the battery contacts I drop my screwdriver all the time It t matter if it s raining I still need to work outside on Saturdays I d like to charge my battery from my cigarette lighter I hate it when t know how much juice is left in the batteries of my cordless tools Need Statement Right The screwdriver battery is protected from accidental shorting The screwdriver operates normally after repeated dropping The screwdriver operates normally in the rain The screwdriver battery can be charged from an automobile cigarette lighter The screwdriver provides an indication of the energy level of the battery Need Statement Wrong The screwdriver battery contacts are covered by a plastic sliding door The screwdriver is rugged The screwdriver is not disabled by the rain An automobile cigarette lighter adapter can charge the screwdriver battery The screwdriver should provide an indication of the energy level of the battery EXHIBIT 5 7 Examples illustrating the guidelines for writing need statements Express the need as an attribute of the product Wording needs as statements about the product ensures consistency and facilitates subsequent translation into product specifications Not all needs can be cleanly expressed as attributes of the product however and in most of these cases the needs can be expressed as attributes of the user of the product e g the user can apply torque manually to the screwdriver to drive a screw Avoid the words must and should The words must and should imply a level of importance for the need Rather than casually assigning a binary importance rating must versus should to the needs at this point we recommend deferring the assessment of the importance of each need until step 4 The list of customer needs is the superset of all the needs elicited from all the inter viewed customers in the target market Some needs may not be technologically realizable The constraints of technical and economic feasibility are incorporated into the process of establishing product specifications in subsequent development steps See Chapter 6 Product Specifications In some cases customers will have expressed conflicting needs At this point in the process the team does not attempt to resolve such conflicts but simply documents both needs Deciding how to address conflicting needs is one of the challenges of the subsequent concept development activities Step 3 Organize the Needs into a Hierarchy The result of steps 1 and 2 should be a list of 50 to 300 need statements Such a large number of detailed needs is awkward to work with and difficult to summarize for use in subsequent development activities The goal of step 3 is to organize these needs into 3 hierarchical list The list will typically consist of a set of primary needs each one of Chapter 5 will be further characterized by a set of secondary needs In cases of very complex products the secondary needs may be broken down into tertiary needs as well The primary needs are the most general needs while the secondary and tertiary needs express needs in more detail Exhibit 5 8 shows the resulting hierarchical list of needs for the screwdriver example For the screwdriver there are 15 primary needs and 49 secondary needs Note that two of the primary needs have no associated secondary needs The procedure for organizing the needs into a hierarchical list is intuitive and many teams can successfully complete the task without detailed instructions For completeness we provide a step by step procedure here This activity is best performed on a wall or a large table by a small group of team members 1 Print or write each need statement on a separate card or self stick note A print macro can be easily written to print the need statements directly from the data template A nice feature of this approach is that the need can be printed in a large font in the center of the card and then the original customer statement and other relevant information can be printed in a small font at the bottom of the card for easy reference Four cards can be cut from a standard printed sheet 2 Eliminate redundant statements Those cards expressing redundant need statements can be stapled together and treated as a single card Be careful to consolidate only those statements that are identical in meaning 3 Group the cards according to the similarity of the needs they express At this point the team should attempt to create groups of roughly three to seven cards that express similar needs The logic by which groups are created deserves special attention Novice development teams often create groups according to a technological perspective clustering needs relating to for example materials packaging or power Or they create groups according to assumed physical components such as enclosure bits switch and battery Both of these approaches are dangerous Recall that the goal of the process is to create a description of the needs of the customer For this reason the groupings should be consistent with the way customers think about their needs and not with the way the development team thinks about the product The groups should correspond to needs customers would view as similar In fact some practitioners use a process in which customers actually organize the need statements 4 For each group choose a label The label is itself a statement of need that generalizes all of the needs in the group It can be selected from one of the needs in the group or the team can write a new need statement 5 Consider creating consisting of two to five groups If there are fewer than 20 groups then a two level hierarchy is probably sufficient to organize the data In this case the group labels are primary needs and the group members are secondary needs However if there are more than 20 groups the team may consider creating and therefore a third level in the hierarchy The process of creating is identical to the process of creating groups As with the previous step cluster groups according to similarity of the need they express and then create or select a label These labels become the primary needs the group labels become the secondary needs and the members of the groups become tertiary needs 6 Review and edit the organized needs statements There is no single correct arrangement of needs in a hierarchy At this point the team may wish to consider alternative groupings or labels and may engage another group to suggest alternative arrangements Identifying Customer Needs 85 I The SD provides plenty of power to drive screws we SD maintains power for several hours of heavy use we S can drive screws into hardwood we SD drives sheet

ratings for the secondary needs are indicated by the number of s with denoting critically important needs Latent needs are denoted by 86 Chapter 5 The process is more complicated when the team attempts to reflect the needs of two or more distinct market segments There are at least two approaches that can be taken to address this challenge First the team can label each need with the segment and possibly the name of the customer from whom the need was elicited This way differences in needs across segments can be observed directly One practical visual technique for this labeling is to use different colors of paper for the cards on which the needs statements are written with each color corresponding to a different market segment The other approach to multiple market segments is to perform the clustering process separately for each market segment Using this approach the team can observe differences both in the needs themselves and in the ways in which these needs are best organized We recommend that the team adopt this parallel independent approach when the segments are very different in their needs and when there is some doubt about the ability of the team to address the different segments with the same product Step 4 Establish the Relative Importance of the Needs The hierarchical list alone does not provide any information on the relative importance that customers place on different needs Yet the development team will have to make trade offs and allocate resources in designing the product A sense of the relative importance of the various needs is essential to making these trade offs correctly Step 4 in the needs process establishes the relative importance of the customer needs identified in steps 1 through 3 The outcome of this step is a numerical importance weighting for a subset of the needs There are two basic approaches to the task 1 relying on the consensus of the team members based on their experience with customers or 2 basing the importance assessment on further customer surveys The obvious trade off between the two approaches is cost and speed versus accuracy the team can make an educated assessment of the relative importance of the needs in one meeting while a customer survey generally takes a minimum of two weeks In most cases we believe the customer survey is important and worth the time required to complete it Other development tasks such as concept generation and analysis of competitive products can begin before the relative importance surveys are complete The team should at this point have developed a rapport with a group of customers These same customers can be surveyed to rate the relative importance of the needs that have been identified The survey can be done in person by telephone via the Internet or by mail Few customers will respond to a survey asking them to evaluate the importance of 100 needs so typically the team will work with only a subset of the needs A practical limit on how many needs can be addressed in a customer survey is about 50 This limit is not too severe however because many of the needs are either obviously important e g the screwdriver fits in a toolbox easily or are easy to implement e g the screwdriver prevents inadvertent switching off The team can therefore limit the scope of the survey by querying customers only about needs that are likely to give rise to difficult technical trade offs or costly features in the product design Such needs would include the need to vary speed the need to drive screws into hardwood and the need to have the screwdriver emit a pleasant sound Alternatively the team could develop a set of surveys to ask a variety of customers each about different subsets of the needs list There are many survey designs for establishing the relative importance of customer needs One good design is illustrated by the portion of the cordless screwdriver survey shown in Exhibit 5 9 In addition to asking for importance ratings Customer Needs 87 Cordless Screwdriver Survey For each of the following cordless screwdriver features please indicate on a scale to 5 how important the feature is to you Please use the following scale 1 Feature is undesirable I would not consider a product with this feature 2 Feature is not important but I would not mind having it 3 Feature would be nice to have but is not necessary 4 Feature is highly desirable but I would consider a product without it 5 Feature is critical I would not consider a product without this feature Also indicate by checking the box to the right if you feel that the feature is unique exciting and or unexpected Importance of feature Check box if feature is unique on scale to 5 The screwdriver maintains power for several hours of heavy use The screwdriver can drive screws into hardwood The screwdriver speed can be controlled by the user while turning a screw The screwdriver has a pleasant sound when in use exciting and or unexpected And so forth EXHIBIT 5 9 Example importance survey partial survey asks the respondent to explicitly identify the needs that are unique or unexpected This information can be used to help the team identify latent needs The survey responses for each need statement can be characterized in a variety of ways by the mean by the standard deviation or by the number of responses in each category The responses can then be used to assign an importance weighting to the need statements The same scale of l to 5 can be used to summarize the importance data The needs in Exhibit 5 8 are rated according to the survey data with the importance ratings denoted by the number of s next to each need statement and the latent needs denoted by Note that no critical needs are also latent needs This is because if a need were critical customers would not be surprised or excited by it they would expect it to be met Step 5 Reflect on the Results and the Process The final step in the method is to reflect on the results and the process While the process of identifying customer needs can be usefully structured it is not an exact science The team must challenge its results to verify that they are consistent with the knowledge and intuition the team has developed through many hours of interaction with customers Some questions to ask include Have we interacted with all of the important types of customers in our target market Are we able to see beyond needs related only to existing products in order to capture the latent needs of our target customers 0 Are there areas of inquiry we should pursue in follow up interviews or surveys Which of the customers we spoke to would be good participants in our ongoing development efforts 88 Chapter 5 What do we know now that we t know when we started Are we surprised by any of the needs Did we involve everyone within our own organization who needs to deeply understand customer needs How might we improve the process in future efforts Summary Identifying customer needs is an integral part of the concept development phase of the product development process The resulting customer needs are used to guide the team in establishing product specifications generating product concepts and selecting a product concept for further development 0 The process of identifying customer needs includes five steps 1 Gather raw data from customers 2 Interpret the raw data in terms of customer needs 3 Organize the needs into a hierarchy 4 Establish the relative importance of the needs 5 Reflect on the results and the process Creating a high quality information channel from customers to the product developers ensures that those who directly control the details of the product including the product designers fully understand the needs of the customer Lead users are a good source of customer needs because they experience new needs months or years ahead of most customers and because they stand to benefit substantially from new product innovations Furthermore they are frequently able to articulate their needs more clearly than typical customers Extreme users have special needs which may reflect latent needs among mainstream users Latent needs may be even more important than explicit needs in determining customer satisfaction Latent needs are those that many customers recognize as important in a final product but do not or cannot articulate in advance Customer needs should be expressed in terms of what the product has to do not in terms of how the product might be implemented Adherence to this principle leaves the development team with maximum flexibility to generate and select product concepts The key benefits of the method are ensuring that the product is focused on customer needs and that no critical customer need is forgotten developing a clear understanding among members of the development team of the needs of the customers in the target market developing a fact base to be used in generating concepts selecting a product concept and establishing product specifications and creating an archival record of the needs phase of the development process References and Bibliography Many current resources are available on the Internet via u

development team Can the process of identifying customer needs lead to the creation of innovative prod concepts In what ways Could a structured process of identifying customer needs lead to a fundamentally new product concept like the Post it Note CHAPTER SIX Product Specifications Courtesy of Specialized Bicycle Components EXHIBIT 6 1 One of Specialized s existing mountain bikes with a suspension fork 9192 Chapter 6 Specialized Bicycle Components was interested in developing a new front suspension fork for the mountain bike market Although the firm was already selling suspension forks on its bicycles Exhibit 6 1 it was interested in exploring designs that would provide higher value for the recreational cyclist The development team had spent a great deal of time identifying customer needs In addition to logging many hours of riding on suspended bikes themselves the members of the team had interviewed lead users at mountain bike races and recreational cyclists on local trails and they also had spent time working with dealers in their stores As a result of this process they had assembled a list of customer needs They now faced several challenges How could the relatively subjective customer needs be translated into precise targets for the remaining development effort How could the team and its senior management agree on what would constitute success or failure of the resulting product design How could the team develop confidence that its intended product would garner a substantial share of the suspension fork market How could the team resolve the inevitable trade offs among product characteristics like cost and weight This chapter presents a method for establishing product specifications We assume that the customer needs are already documented as described in Chapter 5 Identifying Customer Needs The method employs several simple information systems all of which can be constructed using conventional spreadsheet software What Are Specifications Customer needs are generally expressed in the language of the customer The primary customer needs for the suspension fork are listed in Exhibit 6 2 Customer needs such as the suspension is easy to install or the suspension enables high speed descents on bumpy trails are typical in terms of the subjective quality of the expressions However while such expressions are helpful in developing a clear sense of the issues of interest to customers they provide little specific guidance about how to design and engineer the product They simply leave too much margin for subjective interpretation For this reason development teams usually establish a set of specifications which spell out in precise measurable detail what the product has to do Product specifications do not tell the team how to address the customer needs but they do represent an unambiguous agreement on what the team will attempt to achieve in order to satisfy the customer needs For example in contrast to the customer need that the suspension is easy to install the corresponding specification might be that the average time to assemble the fork to the frame is less than 75 seconds We intend the term product Specifications to mean the precise description of what the product has to do Some firms use the terms product requirements or engineering characteristics in this way Other firms use specifications or technical specifications to refer to key design variables of the product such as the oil viscosity or spring constant of the suspension system These are just differences in terminology For clarity let

precise about a few definitions A Specification singular consists of a metric and a value For example average time to assemble is a metric while less than 75 seconds is the value of this metric Note that the value may take on several forms including a particular number a range or an inequality Values are always labeled with the appropriate units e g seconds kilograms joules Together the metric and value form a specification The product Specifications plural are simply the set of the individual specifications When Are Specifications Established In an ideal world the team would establish the product specifications once early in the development process and then proceed to design and engineer the product to exactly meet those specifications For some products such as soap or soup this approach works quite well the technologists on the team can reliably concoct a formulation that satisfies almost any reasonable specifications However for technology intensive products this is rarely possible For such products specifications are established at least twice Immediately after identifying the customer needs the team sets target Specifications These specifications represent the hopes and aspirations of the team but they are established before the team knows what constraints the product technology will place on Chapter 6 I I I I I I I Mission Development Statement Identify Establish Generate Select Test Plan Plan Customer Target Product Product Product Final Downstream Needs Specifications Concepts Concept s Concept s Specifications Development Perform Economic Analysis Benchmark Competitive Products Build Models and Prototypes EXHIBIT 6 3 The concept development process The target specifications are set early in the process but setting the final specifications must wait until after the product concept has been selected can be achieved The team s efforts may fail to meet some of these specifications and may exceed others depending on the product concept the team eventually selects For this reason the target specifications must be refined after a product concept has been selected The team revisits the specifications while assessing the actual technological constraints and the expected production costs To set the final Specifications the team must frequently make hard trade offs among different desirable characteristics of the product For simplicity we present a two stage process for establishing specifications but we note that in some organizations specifications are revisited many times throughout the development process The two stages in which specifications are established are shown as part of the concept development process in Exhibit 6 3 Note that the final specifications are one of the key elements of the development plan which is usually documented in the project s contract book The contract book described in Chapter 18 Managing Projects specifies what the team agrees to achieve the project schedule the required resources and the economic implications for the business The list of product specifications is also one of the key information systems used by the team throughout the development process This chapter presents two methods the first is for establishing the target specifications and the second is for setting the final specifications after the product concept has been selected Establishing Target Specifications As Exhibit 6 3 illustrates the target specifications are established after the customer needs have been identified but before product concepts have been generated and the most promising one s selected An arbitrary setting of the specifications may not be technically feasible For example in designing a suspension fork the team cannot assume in advance that it will be able to achieve simultaneously a mass of l kilogram a manufacturing cost of 30 and the best descent time on the test track as these are three quite aggressive specifications Actually meeting the specifications established at this point is contingent upon the details of the product concept the team eventually selects For this reason such preliminary specifications are labeled target specifications They are the goals of the development team describing a product that the team believes would succeed in the marketplace Later these specifications will be refined based on the limitations of the product concept actually selected Product Specifications 95 The process of establishing the target specifications contains four steps Prepare the list of metrics Collect competitive benchmarking information Set ideal and marginally acceptable target values Reflect on the results and the process Step 1 Prepare the List of Metrics The most useful metrics are those that reflect as directly as possible the degree to which the product satisfies the customer needs The relationship between needs and metrics is central to the entire concept of specifications The working is that a translation from customer needs to a set of precise measurable specifications is possible and that meeting specifications will therefore lead to satisfaction of the associated customer needs A list of metrics is shown in Exhibit 6 4 A good way to generate the list of metrics is to contemplate each need in turn and to consider what precise measurable characteristic of the product will reflect the degree to which the product satisfies that need In the ideal case there is one and only one metric for each need In practice this is frequently not possible For example consider the need that the suspension be easy to install The team may conclude that this need is largely captured by measuring the time required for assembly of the fork to the frame However note the possible subtleties in this translation Is assembly time really identical to ease of installation The installation could be extremely fast but require an awkward and painful set of finger actions which ultimately may lead to worker injury or dealer frustration Because of the imprecise nature of the translation process those establishing the specifications should have been directly involved in identifying the customer needs In this way the team can rely on its understanding of the meaning of each need statement derived from firsthand interactions with customers The need for the fork to reduce vibration to the user s hands may be even more difficult to translate into a single metric because there are many different conditions under which vibration can be transmitted including small bumps on level roads and big bumps on rough trails The team may conclude that several metrics are required to capture this need including for example the metrics attenuation from dropout to handlebar at 10 Hz and maximum value from the Monster The Monster is a suspension test developed by Mountain Bike magazine A simple needs metrics matrix represents the relationship between needs and metrics An example needs metrics matrix is shown in Exhibit 6 5 The rows of the matrix correspond to the customer needs and the columns of the matrix correspond to the metrics A mark in a cell of the matrix means that the need and the metric associated with the cell are related performance relative to the metric will influence the degree to which the product satisfies the customer need This matrix is a key element of the House of Quality a graphical technique used in Quality Function Deployment or Hauser and 1988 In many cases we find the information in the needs metrics matrix is just as easily communicated by listing the numbers of the needs related to each metric alongside the list of metrics the second column in Exhibit 6 4 There are some cases however in which the mapping from needs to metrics is complex and the matrix can be quite useful for representing this mapping 96 Chapter 6 Metric No Need Nos Metric Imp Units 1 1 3 Attenuation from dropout to handlebar at 10 Hz 3 dB 2 2 6 Spring 3 N 3 1 3 Maximum value from the Monster 5 g 4 1 3

shown Subj is an abbreviation indicating that a metric is subjective A few guidelines should be considered when constructing the list of metrics Metrics should be complete Ideally each customer need would correspond to a single metric and the value of that metric would correlate perfectly with satisfaction of that need In practice several metrics may be necessary to completely reflect a single customer need Metrics should be dependent not independent variables This guideline is a variant of the what not how principle introduced in Chapter 5 As do customer needs specifications also indicate what the product must do but not how Specifications 97 F N 0 fl 0 l CO 0 C F N 0 fl 0 l CO 0 C N 0 fl 0 N I C E 9 3 g E S g g m C t E C 1 D a D U 3 m U x C G C E C 3 0 5 o C 5 a u 0 a E u o C D 5 n C

specifications will be achieved Designers use many types of variables in product development some are dependent such as the mass of the fork and some are independent such as the material used for the fork In other words designers cannot control mass directly because it arises from other independent decisions the designers will make such as dimensions and materials choices Metrics specify the overall performance of a product and should therefore be the dependent variables i e the performance measures or output variables in the design problem By using dependent variables for the specifications designers are left with the freedom to achieve the specifications using the best approach possible 98 Chapter 6 Metrics should be practical It does not serve the team to devise a metric for a bicycle suspension that can only be measured by a scientific laboratory at a cost of 100 000 Ideally metrics will be directly observable or analyzable properties of the product that can be easily evaluated by the team Some needs cannot easily be translated into quantifiable metrics The need that the suspension instills pride may be quite critical to success in the fashion conscious mountain bike market but how can pride be quantified In these cases the team simply repeats the need statement as a specification and notes that the metric is subjective and would be evaluated by a panel of customers We indicate this by entering Subj in the units column The metrics should include the popular criteria for comparison in the marketplace Many customers in various markets buy products based on independently published evaluations Such evaluations are found for example in Popular Science Consumer Reports on various Internet sites or in our case in Bicycling and Mountain Bike magazines If the team knows that its product will be evaluated by the trade media and knows what the evaluation criteria will be then it should include metrics corresponding to these criteria Mountain Bike magazine uses a test machine called the Monster which measures the vertical acceleration in g s of the handlebars as a bicycle equipped with the fork runs over a block 50 millimeters tall For this reason the team included maximum value from the Monster as a metric If the team cannot find a relationship between the criteria used by the media and the customer needs it has identified then it should ensure that a need has not been overlooked and or should work with the media to revise the criteria In a few cases the team may conclude that high performance in the media evaluations is in itself a customer need and choose to include a metric used by the media that has little intrinsic technical merit In addition to denoting the needs related to each metric Exhibit 6 4 contains the units of measurement and an importance rating for each metric The units of measurement are most commonly conventional engineering units such as kilograms and seconds However some metrics will not lend themselves to numerical values The need that the suspension works with fenders is best translated into a specification listing the models of fenders with which the fork is compatible In this case the value of the metric is actually a list of fenders rather than a number For the metric involving the standard safety test the value is pass fail We indicate these two cases by entering List and Binary in the units column The importance rating of a metric is derived from the importance ratings of the needs it reflects For cases in which a metric maps directly to a single need the importance rating of the need becomes the importance rating of the metric For cases in which a metric is related to more than one need the importance of the metric is determined by considering the importances of the needs to which it relates and the nature of these relationships We believe that there are enough subtleties in this process that importance weightings can best be determined through discussion among the team members rather than through a formal algorithm When there are relatively few specifications and establishing the relative importance of these specifications is critically important conjoint analysis may be useful Conjoint analysis is described briefly later in this chapter and publications explaining the technique are referenced at the end of the chapter Product Specifications 99 Step 2 Collect Competitive Benchmarking Information Unless the team expects to enjoy a total monopoly the relationship of the new product to competitive products is paramount in determining commercial success While the team will have entered the product development process with some idea of how it wishes to compete in the marketplace the target specifications are the language the team uses to discuss and agree on the detailed positioning of its product relative to existing products both its own and competitors Information on competing products must be gathered to support these positioning decisions An example of a competitive benchmarking chart is shown in Exhibit 6 6 The columns of the chart correspond to the competitive products and the rows are the metrics established in step 1 Note that the competitive benchmarking chart can be constructed as a simple appendage to the spreadsheet containing the list of metrics This information is one of the rooms in the House of Quality described by Hauser and The benchmarking chart is conceptually very simple For each competitive product the values of the metrics are simply entered down a column Gathering these data can be very time consuming involving at the least purchasing testing disassembling and estimating the production costs of the most important competitive products However this investment of time is essential as no product development team can expect to succeed without having this type of information A word of warning Sometimes the data contained in competitors catalogs and supporting literature are not accurate Where possible values of the key metrics should be verified by independent testing or observation An alternative competitive benchmarking chart can be constructed with rows corresponding to the customer needs and columns corresponding to the competitive products see Exhibit 6 7 This chart is used to compare customers perceptions of the relative degree to which the products satisfy their needs Constructing this chart requires collecting customer perception data which can also be very expensive and time consuming Some techniques for measuring customers perceptions of satisfaction of needs are contained in a book by Urban and Hauser 1993 Both charts can be useful and any discrepancies between the two are instructive At a minimum a chart showing the competitive values of the metrics Exhibit 6 6 should be created Step 3 Set Ideal and Marginally Acceptable Target Values In this step the team synthesizes the available information in order to actually set the target values for the metrics Two types of target value are useful an ideal value and a marginally acceptable value The ideal value is the best result the team could hope for The marginally acceptable value is the value of the metric that would just barely make the product commercially viable Both of these targets are useful in guiding the subsequent stages of concept generation and concept selection and for refining the specifications after the product concept has been selected There are five ways to express the values of the metrics At least X These specifications establish targets for the lower bound on a metric but higher is still better For example the value of the brake mounting stiffness is specified to be at least 325 meter At most X These specifications establish targets for the upper bound on a metric with smaller values being better For example the value for the mass of the suspension fork is set to be at most 1 4 kilograms 100 Chapter 6 Metric Need ST Head No Nos Metric Imp Units 2 Ti

bounds for the value of a metric For example the value for the spring is set to be between 480 and 800 newtons Any more and the suspension is harsh any less and the suspension is too bouncy Exactly X These specifications establish a target of a particular value of a metric with any deviation degrading performance For example the ideal value for the rake offset metric is set to 38 millimeters This type of specification is to be avoided if possible because such specifications substantially constrain the design Often upon reconsideration the team realizes that what initially appears as an exactly X specification can be expressed as a between X and Y specification A set of discrete values Some metrics will have values corresponding to several discrete choices For example the headset diameters are 1 000 1 125 or 1 250 inches Industry practice is to use English units for these and several other critical bicycle dimensions Product 101 Metric Need ST Head No Nos Metric Imp Units 2 Ti 21 Pro 14

target as for example the fork tip lateral stiffness is no more than 20 percent of the lateral stiffness at the brake pivots In applications where the team feels this level of complexity is warranted such targets can easily be included although we recommend that this level of complexity not be introduced until the final phase of the specifications process Using these five different types of expressions for values of the metrics the team sets the target specifications The team simply proceeds down the list of metrics and assigns both the marginally acceptable and ideal target values for each metric These decisions are facilitated by the metric based competitive benchmarking chart shown in Exhibit 6 6 To set the target values the team has many considerations including the capability of competing products available at the time competitors future product capabilities if these are predictable and the product s mission statement and target market segment Exhibit 6 8 shows the targets

need Product Specifications 1 03 Because most of the values are expressed in terms of bounds upper or lower or both the team is establishing the boundaries of the competitively viable product space The team hopes that the product will meet some of the ideal targets but is confident that a product can be commercially viable even if it exhibits one or more marginally acceptable characteristics Note that these specifications are preliminary because until a product concept is chosen and some of the design details are worked out many of the exact trade offs are uncertain Step 4 Reflect on the Results and the Process The team may require some iteration to agree on the targets Reflection after each iteration helps to ensure that the results are consistent with the goals of the project Questions to consider include 0 Are members of the team gaming For example is the key marketing representative insisting that an aggressive value is required for a particular metric in the hopes that by setting a high goal the team will actually achieve more than if his or her true and more lenient beliefs were expressed Should the team consider offering multiple products or at least multiple options for the product in order to best match the particular needs of more than one market segment or will one average product suffice 0 Are any specifications missing Do the specifications reflect the characteristics that will dictate commercial success Once the targets have been set the team can proceed to generate solution concepts The target specifications then can be used to help the team select a concept and will help the team know when a concept is commercially viable See Chapter 7 Concept Generation and Chapter 8 Concept Selection Setting the Final Specifications As the team finalizes the choice of a concept and prepares for subsequent design and development the specifications are revisited Specifications that originally were only targets expressed as broad ranges of values are now refined and made more precise Finalizing the specifications is difficult because of trade offs inverse relationships between two specifications that are inherent in the selected product concept Trade offs frequently occur between different technical performance metrics and almost always occur between technical performance metrics and cost For example one trade off is between brake mounting stiffness and mass of the fork Because of the basic mechanics of the fork structure these specifications are inversely related assuming other factors are held constant Another trade off is between cost and mass For a given concept the team may be able to reduce the mass of the fork by making some parts out of titanium instead of steel Unfortunately decreasing the mass in this way will most likely increase the manufacturing cost of the product The difficult part of refining the specifications is choosing how such trade offs will be resolved 104 Chapter 6 Metric Need Marginal Ideal

spreadsheet as a simple extension to the list of specifications Product Specifications 1 05 Here we propose a five step process Develop technical models of the product Develop a cost model of the product Refine the specifications making trade offs where necessary Flow down the specifications as appropriate 9 Reflect on the results and the process Step 1 Develop Technical Models of the Product A technical model of the product is a tool for predicting the values of the metrics for a particular set of design decisions We intend the term models to refer to both analytical and physical approximations of the product See Chapter 14 Prototyping for further discussion of such models At this point the team had chosen an oil damped coil spring concept for the suspension fork The design decisions facing the team included details such as the materials for the structural components the orifice diameter and oil viscosity for the damper and the spring constant Three models linking such design decisions to the performance metrics are shown in conceptual form in Exhibit 6 9 Such models can be used to predict the product s performance along a number of dimensions The inputs to these models are the independent design variables associated with the product concept such as oil viscosity orifice diameter spring constant and geometry The outputs of the model are the values of the metrics such as attenuation stiffness and fatigue life Ideally the team will be able to accurately model the product analytically perhaps by implementing the model equations in a spreadsheet or computer simulation Such a model allows the team to predict rapidly what type of performance can be expected from a particular choice of design variables without costly physical experimentation In most cases such analytical models will be available for only a small subset of the metrics For example the team was able to model attenuation analytically based on the engineers knowledge of dynamic systems Several independent models each corresponding to a subset of the metrics may be more manageable than one large integrated model For example the team developed a separate analytical model for the brake mounting stiffness that was completely independent of the dynamic model used to predict vibration attenuation In some cases no analytical models will be available at all For example the team was not able to model analytically the fatigue performance of the suspension so physical models were built and tested It is generally necessary to actually build a variety of different physical mock ups or prototypes in order to explore the implications of several combinations of design variables To reduce the number of models that must be constructed it is useful to employ design of experiments DOE techniques which can minimize the number of experiments required to explore the design space See Chapter 15 Robust Design for a summary of DOE methods Armed with these technical models the team can predict whether any particular set of specifications such as the ideal target values is technically feasible by exploring different combinations of design variables This type of modeling and analysis prevents the team from setting a combination of specifications that cannot be achieved using the available latitude in the product concept 106 Chapter 6 Suspended Mass Unsprung Mass Orifice

Physical Design Variables Model Inputs Metrics Model Outputs EXHIBIT 6 9 Models used to assess technical feasibility Technical models may be analytical or physical approximations of the product concept Note that a technical model is almost always unique to a particular product concept One of the models illustrated in Exhibit 6 9 is for an oil damped suspension system the model would be substantially different if the team had selected a concept employing a rubber suspension element Thus the modeling step can only be performed after the concept has been chosen Step 2 Develop a Cost Model of the Product The goal of this step of the process is to make sure that the product can be produced at the target cost The target cost is the manufacturing cost at which the company and its distribution partners can make adequate profits while still offering the product to the end customer at a competitive price The appendix to this chapter provides an explanation of target costing It is at this point that the team attempts to discover for example how much it will have to sacrifice in manufacturing cost to save 50 grams of mass For most products the first estimates of manufacturing costs are completed by drafting a bill of materials a list of all the parts and estimating a purchase price or fabrication cost for each part At this point in the development process the team does not generally know all of the components that will be in the product but the team nevertheless makes an attempt to list the components it expects will be required While early estimates generally focus on the cost of components the team will usually make a rough estimate of assembly and other manufacturing costs e g overhead at this point as well Efforts to develop these early cost estimates involve soliciting cost estimates from vendors and estimating the production costs of the components the firm will make itself This Specifications 1 07 Qty High Low High Total Low Total Component Fork 5 ea 5

early cost estimates to facilitate realistic trade offs in the product specifications is often facilitated by a purchasing expert and a production engineer A bill of materials cost model is shown in Exhibit 6 10 for the suspension fork See Chapter 13 Design for Manufacturing for more details on estimating manufacturing cost A useful way to record cost information is to list figures for the high and low estimates of each item This helps the team to understand the range of uncertainty in the estimates The bill of materials is typically used iteratively the team performs a what if cost analysis for a set of design decisions and then revises these decisions based on what it learns The bill of materials is itself a kind of performance model but instead of predicting the value of a technical performance metric it predicts cost performance The bill of materials remains useful throughout the development process and is updated regularly as frequently as once each week to reflect the current status of the estimated manufacturing cost At this point in the development process teams developing complex products containing hundreds or thousands of parts will not generally be able to include every part in the bill of materials Instead the team will list the major components and subsystems and place bounds on their costs based on past experience or on the judgment of suppliers 108 Chapter 6 120 110 100 O O 80 70 Estimated Manufacturing Cost 60 50 3 0 Ideal Values Step 3 Refine the Specifications Making Trade Offs Where Necessary Once the team has constructed technical performance models where possible and constructed a preliminary cost model these tools can be used to develop final specifications Finalizing specifications can be accomplished in a group session in which feasible combinations of values are determined through the use of the technical models and then the cost implications are explored In an iterative fashion the team converges on the specifications that will most favorably position the product relative to the competition will best satisfy the customer needs and will ensure adequate profits One important tool for supporting this decision making process is the competitive map An example competitive map is shown in Exhibit 6 11 This map is simply a scatter plot of the competitive products along two dimensions selected from the set of metrics and is sometimes called a trade off map The map displayed in Exhibit 6 11 shows estimated manufacturing cost versus score on the Monster test The regions defined by the marginal and ideal values of the specifications are shown on the map This map is particularly useful in showing that all of the high performance suspensions low Monster scores have high estimated manufacturing costs Armed with technical performance models and a cost model the team can assess whether or not it will be able to beat the trade off exhibited in the competitive map O 21 O 2 Head O O Pro O Trade Off Curve for

for two suspension concepts are also drawn on this map Product Specifications 1 09 These maps can be constructed directly from the data contained in the competitive benchmarking chart using the plotting feature of the spreadsheet software Generally the team will prepare three or four such maps corresponding to a handful of critical metrics Additional maps may be created as needed to support subsequent decision making The competitive map is used to position the new product relative to the competition Trade off curves showing performance of the product concept for a range of design variables can be drawn directly on the competitive map as shown in Exhibit 6 11 Using the technical and cost models of the product and the competitive maps the team can refine the specifications in order to both satisfy the inherent constraints of the product concept and make the trade offs in a way that will provide a performance advantage relative to the competitive products The final specifications for the suspension fork are shown in Exhibit 6 12 For relatively mature product categories in which competition is based on performance relative to a handful of well understood performance metrics conjoint analysis may be useful in refining product specifications Conjoint analysis uses customer survey data to construct a model of customer preference Essentially each respondent in a sample of potential customers is repeatedly asked to evaluate hypothetical products characterized by a set of attributes These attributes must generally be metrics that are easily understood by customers e g fuel economy and price for automobiles Subjective attributes e g styling can be represented graphically The hypothetical products are constructed using the statistical techniques of experimental design Using customer responses conjoint analysis infers the relative importance of each attribute to the customer These data can then be used to predict which product a customer would choose when offered a hypothetical set of alternatives By using these predictions for all of the customers in a sample the market share of each product in the set of alternatives can be forecast Using this approach the specification values that maximize market share can be estimated The details of conjoint analysis are fairly straightforward but beyond the scope of this chapter Relevant references are listed at the end of the chapter Step 4 Flow Down the Specifications as Appropriate This chapter focuses on the specifications for a relatively simple component designed by a single relatively small development team Establishing specifications takes on additional importance and is substantially more challenging when developing a highly complex product consisting of multiple subsystems designed by multiple development teams In such a context specifications are used to define the development objectives of each of the subsystems as well as for the product as a whole The challenge in this case is to flow down the overall specifications to specifications for each subsystem For example the overall specifications for an automobile contain metrics like fuel economy 0 100 kilometer hour acceleration time and turning radius However specifications must also be created for the several dozen major subsystems that make up the automobile including the body engine transmission braking system and suspension The specifications for the engine include metrics like peak power peak torque and fuel consumption at peak efficiency One challenge in the flow down process is to ensure that the subsystem specifications in fact reflect the overall product specifications that if specifications for the subsystems are achieved the overall product specifications will be achieved A second challenge is to ensure that certain specifications for different subsystems are 10 Chapter 6 EXHIBIT 6 1 2 The final specifications No Metric Unit Value 1 Attenuation from dropout

specification for the engine is not inordinately more difficult to meet than is the mass specification for the body Otherwise the cost of the product will likely be higher than necessary Some overall component specifications can be established through budget allocations For example specifications for manufacturing cost mass and power consumption can be allocated to subsystems with the confidence that the overall cost mass and power consumption of the product will simply be the sum of these quantities for each subsystem Product Specifications 1 1 1 To some extent geometric volume can be allocated this way as well Other component specifications must be established through a more complex understanding of how subsystem performance relates to overall product performance For example fuel efficiency is a relatively complex function of vehicle mass rolling resistance aerodynamic drag coefficient frontal area and engine efficiency Establishing specifications for the body tires and engine requires a model of how these variables relate to overall fuel efficiency A comprehensive treatment of flowing down specifications for complex products is beyond the scope of this chapter and in fact is a major focus of the field of systems engineering We refer the reader to several useful books on this subject in the reference list Step 5 Reflect on the Results and the Process As always the final step in the method is to reflect on the outcome and the process Some questions the team may want to consider are Is the product a winner The product concept should allow the team to actually set the specifications so that the product will meet the customer needs and excel competitively If not then the team should return to the concept generation and selection phase or abandon the project 0 How much uncertainty is there in the technical and cost models If competitive success is dictated by metrics around which much uncertainty remains the team may wish to refine the technical or cost models in order to increase confidence in meeting the specifications Is the concept chosen by the team best suited to the target market or could it be best applied in another market say the low end or high end instead of the middle The selected concept may actually be too good If the team has generated a concept that is dramatically superior to the competitive products it may wish to consider employing the concept in a more demanding and potentially more profitable market segment 0 Should the firm initiate a formal effort to develop better technical models of some aspect of the product s performance for future use Sometimes the team will discover that it does not really understand the underlying product technology well enough to create useful performance models In such circumstances an engineering effort to develop better understanding and models may be useful in subsequent development Summary Customer needs are generally expressed in the language of the customer In order to provide specific guidance about how to design and engineer a product development teams establish a set of specifications which spell out in precise measurable detail what the product has to do to be commercially successful The specifications must reflect the customer needs differentiate the product from the competitive products and be technically and economically realizable Specifications are typically established at least twice Immediately after identifying the customer needs the team sets target specifications After concept selection and testing the team develops final specifications 1 1 2 Chapter 6 Target specifications represent the hopes and aspirations of the team but they are established before the team knows the constraints the product technology will place on what can be achieved The team s efforts may fail to meet some of these specifications and may exceed others depending on the details of the product concept the team eventually selects The process of establishing the target specifications entails four steps 1 Prepare the list of metrics 2 Collect competitive benchmarking information 3 Set ideal and marginally acceptable target values 4 Reflect on the results and the process Final specifications are developed by assessing the actual technological constraints and the expected production costs using analytical and physical models During this refinement phase the team must make difficult trade offs among various desirable characteristics of the product The five step process for refining the specifications is 1 Develop technical models of the product 2 Develop a cost model of the product 3 Refine the specifications making trade offs where necessary 4 Flow down the specifications as appropriate 5 Reflect on the results and the process The specifications process is facilitated by several simple information systems that can easily be created using conventional spreadsheet software Tools such as the list of metrics the needs metrics matrix the competitive benchmarking charts and the competitive maps all support the team s decision making by providing the team with a way to represent and discuss the specifications Because of the need to utilize the best possible knowledge of the market the customers the core product technology and the cost implications of design alternatives the specifications process requires active participation from team members representing the marketing design and manufacturing functions of the enterprise References and Bibliography Many current resources are available on the Internet via u rich net The process of translating customer needs into a set of specifications is also accomplished by the Quality Function Deployment method The key ideas behind and the House of Quality are clearly presented by Hauser and in a popular article Hauser John and Don The House of Quality Harvard Business Review Vol 66 No 3 May June 1988 pp 63 73 Urban and Hauser present several techniques for selecting combinations of product attributes in order to maximize customer satisfaction Some of these techniques can serve as powerful analytical support for the general method described in this

Summer 1999 pp 23 33 Exercises 1 List a set of metrics corresponding to the need that a pen write smoothly 2 Devise a metric and a corresponding test for the need that a roofing material last many years 3 Some of the same metrics seem to be involved in trade offs for many different products What are some examples of such metrics Thought Questions 1 How might you establish precise and measurable specifications for intangible needs such as the front suspension looks great 2 Why are some customer needs difficult to map to a single metric 3 How might you explain a situation in which customers perceptions of the competitive products as in Exhibit 6 7 are not consistent with the values of the metrics for those same products as in Exhibit 6 6 4 Can poor performance relative to one specification always be compensated for by high performance on other specifications If so how can there ever really be a marginally acceptable value for a metric 5 Why should independent design variables not be used as metrics 1 14 Chapter 6 Appendix Target Costing Target costing is a simple idea set the value of the manufacturing cost specification based on the price the company hopes the end user will pay for the product and on the profit margins that are required for each stage in the distribution channel For example assume Specialized wishes to sell its suspension fork to its customers through bicycle shops If the price it expected the customer to pay was 250 and if bicycle shops normally expect a gross profit margin of 45 percent on components then Specialized would have to sell its fork to bicycle shops for 1 0 45 250 137 50 If Specialized wishes to earn a gross margin of at least 40 percent on its components then its unit manufacturing cost must be less than 1 0 40 137 50 82 50 Target costing is the reverse of the cost plus approach to pricing The cost plus approach begins with what the firm expects its manufacturing costs to be and then sets its prices by adding its expected profit margin to the cost This approach ignores the realities of competitive markets in which prices are driven by market and customer factors Target costing is a mechanism for ensuring that specifications are set in a way that allows the product to be competitively priced in the marketplace Some products are sold directly by a manufacturer to end users of the product Frequently products are distributed through one or more intermediate stages such as distributors and retailers Exhibit 6 13 provides some approximate values of gross profit margins for different product categories Let M be the gross profit margin of a stage in the distribution channel P C P M where P is the price this stage charges its customers and C is the cost this stage pays for the product it sells Note that mark up is similar to margin but is defined slightly differently as P C 1 so that a margin of 50 percent is equivalent to a mark up of 100 percent Target cost C is given by the following expression C P l I 1 Mi where P is the price paid by the end user n is the number of stages in the distribution channel and M is the margin of the stage EXAMPLE Assume the end user price P equals 250 If the product is sold directly to the end user by the manufacturer and the desired gross profit margin of the manufacturer Mm equals 0 40 then the target cost is C P 1 M 250 1 0 40

including competitive intensity the volume of units sold and the level of customer support required Sales representatives are paid by commission and are not strictly part of the distribution channel However the team may Wish to account for commissions in its analysis of target cost 1 16 Chapter 6 If the product is sold through a retailer and the desired gross profit margin for the retailer Mr equals 0 45 then C P 1 Mm 1 Mr 250 1 0 40 1 0 45 82 50 If the product is sold through a distributor and a retailer and the desired gross profit margin for the distributor Md equals 0 20 then C P 1 Mm

commissioned a team to develop a new nailer for the roofing market The product that eventually resulted from the effort is shown in Exhibit 7 1 The mission of the team was to consider broadly alternative product concepts assuming only that the tool would employ conventional nails as the basic fastening technology After identifying a set of customer needs and establishing target product specifications the team faced the following questions 0 What existing solution concepts if any could be successfully adapted for this application 0 What new concepts might satisfy the established needs and specifications What methods can be used to facilitate the concept generation process The Activity of Concept Generation A product concept is an approximate description of the technology working principles and form of the product It is a concise description of how the product will satisfy the customer needs A concept is usually expressed as a sketch or as a rough three dimensional model and is often accompanied by a brief textual description The degree to which a product satisfies customers and can be successfully commercialized depends to a large measure on the quality of the underlying concept A good concept is sometimes poorly implemented in subsequent development phases but a poor concept can rarely be manipulated to achieve commercial success Fortunately concept generation is relatively inexpensive and can be done relatively quickly in comparison to the rest of the development process For example concept generation had typically consumed less than 5 percent of the budget and 15 percent of the development time in previous nailer development efforts Because the concept generation activity is not costly there is no excuse for a lack of diligence and care in executing a sound concept generation method The concept generation process begins with a set of customer needs and target specifications and results in a set of product concepts from which the team will make a final selection The relation of concept generation to the other concept development activities is shown in Exhibit 7 2 In most cases an effective development team will generate hundreds of concepts of which 5 to 20 will merit serious consideration during the concept selection activity Mission Statement 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 I I I I I I I Development Identify Establish Generate Select Test Set

Build Models and Prototypes EXHIBIT 7 2 Concept generation is an integral part of the concept development phase Concept Generation 1 19 Good concept generation leaves the team with confidence that the full space of alternatives has been explored Thorough exploration of alternatives early in the development process greatly reduces the likelihood that the team will stumble upon a superior concept late in the development process or that a competitor will introduce a product with dramatically better performance than the product under development Structured Approaches Reduce the Likelihood of Costly Problems Common dysfunctions exhibited by development teams during concept generation include Consideration of only one or two alternatives often proposed by the most assertive members of the team Failure to consider carefully the usefulness of concepts employed by other firms in related and unrelated products 0 Involvement of only one or two people in the process resulting in lack of confidence and commitment by the rest of the team 0 Ineffective integration of promising partial solutions 0 Failure to consider entire categories of solutions A structured approach to concept generation reduces the incidence of these problems by encouraging the gathering of information from many disparate information sources by guiding the team in the thorough exploration of alternatives and by providing a mechanism for integrating partial solutions A structured method also provides a step by step procedure for those members of the team who may be less experienced in design intensive activities allowing them to participate actively in the process A Five Step Method This chapter presents a five step concept generation method The method outlined in Exhibit 7 3 breaks a complex problem into simpler subproblems Solution concepts are then identified for the subproblems by external and internal search procedures Classification trees and concept combination tables are then used to systematically explore the space of solution concepts and to integrate the subproblem solutions into a total solution Finally the team takes a step back to reflect on the validity and applicability of the results as well as on the process used This chapter will follow the recommended method and will describe each of the five steps in detail Although we present the method in a linear sequence concept generation is almost always iterative Like our other development methods these steps are intended to be a baseline from which product development teams can develop and refine their own unique problem solving style Our presentation of the method is focused primarily on the overall concept for a new product however the method can and should be used at several different points in the development process The process is useful not only for overall product concepts but also for concepts for subsystems and specific components as well Also note that while the example in this chapter involves a relatively technical product the same basic approach can be applied to nearly any product 1 20 Chapter 7 EXHIBIT f 3 1 Clarify the e problem step concept generation 0 Understanding method 0

Clarifying the problem consists of developing a general understanding and then breaking the problem down into subproblems if necessary The mission statement for the project the customer needs list and the preliminary product specification are the ideal inputs to the concept generation process although often these pieces of information are still being refined as the concept generation Generation 121 begins Ideally the team has been involved both in the identification of the customer needs and in the setting of the target product specifications Those members of the team who were not involved in these preceding steps should become familiar with the processes used and their results before concept generation activities begin See Chapter 5 Identifying Customer Needs and Chapter 6 Product Specifications As stated before the challenge was to design a better roofing nailer The scope of the design problem could have been defined more generally e g fasten roofing materials or more specifically e g improve the speed of the existing pneumatic tool concept Some of the assumptions in the team s mission statement were 0 The nailer will use nails as opposed to adhesives screws etc 0 The nailer will be compatible with nail magazines on existing tools 0 The nailer will nail through roofing shingles into wood 0 The nailer will be Based on the assumptions the team had identified the customer needs for a nailer These included 0 The nailer inserts nails in rapid succession The nailer is lightweight The nailer has no noticeable nailing delay after tripping the tool The team gathered supplemental information to clarify and quantify the needs such as the approximate energy and speed of the nailing These basic needs were subsequently translated into target product specifications The target specifications included the following 0 Nail lengths from 25 millimeters to 38 millimeters 0 Maximum nailing energy of 40 joules per nail Nailing forces of up to 2 000 newtons 0 Peak nailing rate of one nail per second Average nailing rate of 12 nails per minute 0 Tool mass less than 4 kilograms 0 Maximum trigger delay of 0 25 second Decompose a Complex Problem into Simpler Subproblems Many design challenges are too complex to solve as a single problem and can be usefully divided into several simpler subproblems For example the design of a complex product like a document copier can be thought of as a collection of more focused design problems including for example the design of a document handler the design of a paper feeder the design of a printing device and the design of an image capture device In some cases however the design problem cannot readily be divided into subproblems For example the problem of designing a paper clip may be hard to divide into subproblems As a general rule we feel that teams should attempt to decompose design problems but should be aware that such a decomposition may not be very useful for products with extremely simple functions Dividing a problem into simpler subproblems is called problem decomposition There are many schemes by which a problem can be decomposed Here we demonstrate a functional decomposition and also list several other approaches that are frequently useful 122 Chapter 7 Input Output Energy Energy H h Material nails fined d Material driven nail Signal tool trip Signal a Energy Nails Trip y Store or Convert accept energy to I external I translational energy energy Apply re translational en rim 8 energy to nail a Sense p tool lb EXHIBIT 7 4 Function diagram of a nailer arising from a functional decomposition a overall black box b refinement showing The first step in decomposing a problem functionally is to represent it as a single black box operating on material energy and signal flows as shown in Exhibit 7 4 a Thin solid lines denote the transfer and conversion of energy thick solid lines signify the movement of material within the system and dashed lines represent the flows of control and feedback signals within the system This black box represents the overall function of the product The next step in functional decomposition is to divide the single black box into to create a more specific description of what the elements of the product might do in order to implement the overall function of the product Each can generally be further divided into even simpler The division process is repeated until the team members agree that each is simple enough to work with A good rule of thumb is to create between 3 and 10 in the diagram The end result shown in Exhibit 7 4 b is a function diagram containing connected by energy material and signal flows Concept Generation 123 Note that at this stage the goal is to describe the functional elements of the product without implying a specific technological working principle for the product concept For example Exhibit 7 4 b includes the isolate nail This is expressed in such a way that it does not imply any particular physical solution concept such as indexing the coil of nails into a slot or breaking a nail sideways off of the stick The team should consider each in turn and ask whether it is expressed in a way that does not imply a particular physical solution principle There is no single correct way of creating a function diagram and no single correct functional decomposition of a product A helpful way to create the diagram is to quickly create several drafts and then work to refine them into a single diagram that the team is comfortable with Some useful techniques for getting started are 0 Create a function diagram of an existing product 0 Create a function diagram based on an arbitrary product concept already generated by the team or based on a known technology Be sure to generalize the diagram to the appropriate level of abstraction Follow one of the flows e g material and determine what operations are required The details of the other flows can be derived by thinking about their connections to the initial flow Note that the function diagram is typically not unique In particular can often be ordered in different ways to produce different function diagrams Also note that in some applications the material energy and signal flows are difficult to identify In these cases a simple list of the of the product without connections between them is often sufficient Functional decomposition is most applicable to technical products but it can also be applied to simple and apparently nontechnical products For example an ice cream scoop has material flow of ice cream being separated formed transported and deposited These could form the basis of a problem decomposition Functional decomposition is only one of several possible ways to divide a problem into simpler subproblems Two other approaches are Decomposition by sequence of user actions For example the nailer problem might be broken down into three user actions moving the tool to the gross nailing position positioning the tool precisely and triggering the tool This approach is often useful for products with very simple technical functions involving a lot of user interaction Decomposition by key customer needs For the nailer this decomposition might include the following subproblems fires nails in rapid succession is lightweight and has a large nail capacity This approach is often useful for products in which form and not working principles or technology is the primary problem Examples of such products include toothbrushes assuming the basic brush concept is retained and storage containers Focus Initial Efforts on the Critical Subproblems The goal of all of these decomposition techniques is to divide a complex problem into simpler problems such that these simpler problems can be tackled in a focused way Once problem decomposition is complete the team chooses the subproblems that are most critical to the success of the product and that are most likely to benefit from novel or 24 Chapter 7 solutions This approach involves a conscious decision to defer the solution of some of the subproblems For example the nailer team chose to focus on the subproblems of storing accepting energy converting the energy to translational energy and applying the translational energy to the nail The team felt confident that the nail handling and triggering issues could be solved after the energy storage and conversion issues were addressed The team also deferred most of the user interaction issues of the tool The team believed that the choice of a basic working principle for the tool would so constrain the eventual form of the tool that they had to begin with the core technology and then proceed to consider how to embody that technology in an attractive and user friendly form Teams can usually agree after a few minutes of discussion on which subproblems should be addressed first and which should be deferred for later consideration Step 2 Search Externally External search is aimed at finding existing solutions to both the overall problem and the subproblems identified during the problem clarification step While external search is listed as the second step in the concept generation method this sequential labeling is deceptive external search occurs continually throughout the development process Implementing an existing solution is usually quicker and cheaper than developing a new solution Liberal use of existing solutions allows the team to focus its creative energy on the critical subproblems for which there are no satisfactory prior solutions Furthermore a conventional solution to one subproblem can frequently be combined with a novel solution to another subproblem to yield a superior overall design For this reason external search includes detailed evaluation not only of directly competitive products but also of technologies used in products with related The external search for solutions is essentially an information gathering process Available time and resources can be optimized by using an expand and focus strategy first expand the scope of the search by broadly gathering information that might be related to the problem and then focus the scope of the search by exploring the promising directions in more detail Too much of either approach will make the external search inefficient There are at least five good ways to gather information from external sources lead user interviews expert consultation patent searches literature searches and competitive benchmarking Interview Lead Users While identifying customer needs the team may have sought out or encountered lead users Lead users are those users of a product who experience needs months or years before the majority of the market and stand to benefit substantially from a product innovation 1988 Frequently these lead users will have already invented solutions to meet their needs This is particularly true among highly technical user communities such as those in the medical or scientific fields Lead users may be sought out in the market for which the team is developing the new product or they may be found in markets for products implementing some of the of the product In the nailer case the nailer team consulted with the building contractors from the PBS television series This Old House in order to solicit new concepts These lead users who are exposed to tools from many manufacturers made many Generation 125 observations about the weaknesses in existing tools but in this case did not provide many new product concepts Consult Experts Experts with knowledge of one or more of the subproblems not only can provide solution concepts directly but also can redirect the search in a more fruitful area Experts may include professionals at firms manufacturing related products professional consultants university faculty and technical representatives of suppliers These people can be found by calling universities by calling companies and by looking up authors of articles While finding experts can be hard work it is almost always less time consuming than re creating existing knowledge Most experts are willing to talk on the telephone or meet in person for an hour or so without charge In general consultants will expect to be paid for time they spend on a problem beyond an initial meeting or telephone conversation Suppliers are usually willing to provide several days of effort without direct compensation if they anticipate that someone will use their product as a component in a design Of course experts at directly competing firms are in most cases unwilling to provide proprietary information about their product designs A good habit to develop is to always ask people consulted to suggest others who should be contacted The best information often comes from pursuing these second generation leads The nailer design team consulted dozens of experts including a rocket fuel specialist electric motor researchers at MIT and engineers from a vendor of gas springs Most of this consultation was done on the telephone although the engineers from the spring vendor made two trips to visit the team at their company s expense Search Patents Patents are a rich and readily available source of technical information containing detailed drawings and explanations of how many products work The main disadvantage of patent searches is that concepts found in recent patents are protected generally for 20 years from the date of the patent application so there may be a royalty involved in using them However patents are also useful to see what concepts are already protected and must be avoided or licensed Concepts contained in foreign patents without global coverage and in expired patents can be used without payment of royalties See Chapter 16 Patents and Intellectual Property for an explanation of patent rights and how to understand patent claims The formal indexing scheme for patents is difficult for novices to navigate Fortunately several databases contain the actual text of all patents These text databases can be searched electronically by key words Key word searches can be conducted efficiently with only modest practice and are remarkably effective in finding patents relevant to a particular product Copies of U S patents including illustrations can be obtained for a nominal fee from the U S Patent and Trademark Office and from several suppliers See the Web site net for a current list of patent databases and suppliers of patent documents A U S patent search in the area of revealed several interesting concepts One of the patents described a motor driven double flywheel nailer One of the illustrations from this patent is shown in Exhibit 7 5 The design in this patent uses the accumulation of rotational kinetic energy in a flywheel which is then suddenly converted into translational energy by a friction clutch The energy is then delivered to the nail with a single impact of a drive pin 1 26 Chapter 7 28 amen E i A 7 71

nine pages long Search Published Literature Published literature includes journals conference proceedings trade magazines government reports market consumer and product information and new product announce Literature searches are therefore very fertile sources of existing solutions Electronic searches are frequently the most efficient way to gather information from published literature Searching the Internet is often a good first step although the quality of the results can be hard to assess More structured databases are available from sources Many databases store only abstracts of articles and not the full text and diagrams A follow up search for an actual article is often needed for complete information The two main difficulties in conducting good database searches are determining the key words and limiting the scope of the search There is a trade off between the need to use more key words for complete coverage and the need to restrict the number of matches to a manage able number Concept Generation 127 Handbooks cataloging technical information can also be very useful references for external search Examples of such engineering references are Marks Standard Handbook of Mechanical Engineering Chemical Engineers Handbook and Mechanisms and Mechanical Devices The nailer team found several useful articles related to the subproblems including articles on energy storage describing flywheel and battery technologies In a handbook they found an impact tool mechanism that provided a useful energy conversion concept Benchmark Related Products In the context of concept generation benchmarking is the study of existing products with functionality similar to that of the product under development or to the subproblems on which the team is focused Benchmarking can reveal existing concepts that have been implemented to solve a particular problem as well as information on the strengths and weaknesses of the competition At this point the team will likely already be familiar with the competitive and closely related products Products in other markets but with related functionality are more difficult to find One of the most useful sources of this information is the Thomas Register a directory of manufacturers of industrial products organized by product type Often the hardest part of using the Thomas Register is finding out what related products are actually called and how they are cataloged The Thomas Register database can be accessed via the Internet For the nailer the closely related products included a single shot gunpowder actuated tool for nailing into concrete an electrical solenoid actuated tacker a pneumatic nailer for factory use and a palm held pneumatic nailer The products with related functionality in this case energy storage and conversion included air bags and the sodium propellant used as an energy source chemical hand warmers for skiing air rifles powered by carbon dioxide cartridges and portable computers and their battery packs The team obtained and disassembled most of these related products in order to discover the general concepts on which they were based as well as other more detailed information including for example the names of the suppliers of specific components External search is an important method of gathering solution concepts Skill in conducting external searches is therefore a valuable personal and organizational asset This ability can be developed through careful observation of the world in order to develop a mental database of technologies and through the development of a network of professional contacts Even with the aid of personal knowledge and contacts external search remains detective work and is completed most effectively by those who are persistent and resourceful in pursuing leads and opportunities Step 3 Search Internally Internal search is the use of personal and team knowledge and creativity to generate solution concepts Often called brainstorming this type of search is internal in that all of the ideas to emerge from this step are created from knowledge already in the possession of the team This activity may be the most open ended and creative of any task in product development We find it useful to think of internal search as a process of retrieving a potentially useful piece of information from one s memory and then Chapter 7 that information to the problem at hand This process can be carried out by individuals working in isolation or by a group of people working together Four guidelines are useful for improving both individual and group internal search 1 Suspend judgment In most aspects of daily life success depends on an ability to quickly evaluate a set of alternatives and take action For example none of us would be very productive if deciding what to wear in the morning or what to eat for breakfast involved an extensive period of generating alternatives before making a judgment Because most decisions in our day to day lives have implications of only a few minutes or hours we are accustomed to making decisions quickly and moving on Concept generation for product development is fundamentally different We have to live with the consequences of product concept decisions for years As a result suspending evaluation for the days or weeks required to generate a large set of alternatives is critical to success The imperative to suspend judgment is frequently translated into the rule that during group concept generation sessions no criticism of concepts is allowed A better approach is for individuals perceiving weaknesses in concepts to channel any judgmental tendencies into suggestions for improvements or alternative concepts 2 Generate a lot of ideas Most experts believe that the more ideas a team generates the more likely the team is to explore fully the solution space Striving for quantity lowers the expectations of quality for any particular idea and therefore may encourage people to share ideas they may otherwise view as not worth mentioning Further each idea acts as a stimulus for other ideas so a large number of ideas has the potential to stimulate even more ideas 3 Welcome ideas that may seem infeasible Ideas which initially appear infeasible can often be improved debugged or repaired by other members of the team The more infeasible an idea the more it stretches the boundaries of the solution space and encourages the team to think of the limits of possibility Therefore infeasible ideas are quite valuable and their expression should be encouraged 4 Use graphical and physical media Reasoning about physical and geometric information with words is difficult Text and verbal language are inherently inefficient vehicles for describing physical entities Whether working as a group or as an individual abundant sketching surfaces should be available Foam clay cardboard and other media may also be appropriate aids for problems requiring a deep understanding of form and spatial relationships Both Individual and Group Sessions Can Be Useful Formal studies of group and individual problem solving suggest that a set of people working alone for a period of time will generate more and better concepts than the same people working together for the same time period McGrath 1984 This finding is contrary to the actual practices of the many firms that perform most of their concept generation activities in group sessions Our observations confirm the formal studies and we believe that team members should spend at least some of their concept generation time working alone We also believe that group sessions are critical for building consensus communicating information and refining concepts In an ideal setting each individual on the team would spend several hours working alone and then the group would get together to discuss and improve the concepts generated by individuals Concept Generation 129 However we also know that there is a practical reason for holding group concept generation sessions it is one way to guarantee that the individuals in the group will devote a certain amount of time to the task Especially in very intense and demanding work environments without scheduling a meeting few people will allocate several hours for concentrated individual effort on generating new concepts The phone rings people interrupt urgent problems and e mails demand attention In certain environments scheduled group sessions may be the only way to guarantee that enough attention is paid to the concept generation activity The nailer team used both individual effort and group sessions for internal search For example during one particular week each member was assigned one or two subproblems and was expected to develop at least 10 solution concepts This divided the concept generation work among all members The group then met to discuss and expand on the individually generated concepts The more promising concepts were investigated further Hints for Generating Solution Concepts Experienced individuals and teams can usually just sit down and begin generating good concepts for a subproblem Often these people have developed a set of techniques they use to stimulate their thinking and these techniques have become a natural part of their problem solving process Novice product development professionals may be aided by a set of hints that stimulate new ideas or encourage relationships among ideas 1988 1998 and 1980 give dozens of helpful suggestions Here are some hints we have found to be helpful Make analogies Experienced designers always ask themselves what other devices solve a related problem Frequently they will ask themselves if there is a natural or biological analogy to the problem They will think about whether their problem exists at a much larger or smaller dimensional scale than that which they are considering They will ask what devices do something similar in an unrelated area of application The nailer team when posing these questions realized that construction pile drivers are similar to in some respects In following up on this idea they developed the concept of a tool Wish and wonder Beginning a thought or comment with I wish we could or I wonder what would happen if helps to stimulate oneself or the group to consider new possibilities These questions cause reflection on the boundaries of the problem For example a member of the nailer team when confronted with the required length of a rail gun an electromagnetic device for accelerating a projectile for driving a nail said I wish the tool could be 1 meter long Discussion of this comment led to the idea that perhaps a long tool could be used like a cane for nailing decking allowing users to remain on their feet Use related stimuli Most individuals can think of a new idea when presented with a new stimulus Related stimuli are those stimuli generated in the context of the problem at hand For example one way to use related stimuli is for each individual in a group session to generate a list of ideas working alone and then pass the list to his or her neighbor Upon reflection on someone else s ideas most people are able to generate new ideas Other related stimuli include customer needs statements and photographs of the use environment of the product 130 Chapter 7 Use unrelated stimuli Occasionally random or unrelated stimuli can be effective in encouraging new ideas An example of such a technique is to choose at random one of a collection of photographs of objects and then to think of some way that the randomly generated object might relate to the problem at hand In a variant of this idea individuals can be sent out on the streets with a digital camera to capture random images for subsequent use in stimulating new ideas This may also serve as a good change of pace for a tired group Set quantitative goals Generating new ideas can be exhausting Near the end of a session individuals and groups may find quantitative goals useful as a motivating force The nailer team frequently issued individual concept generation assignments with quantitative targets of 10 to 20 concepts Use the gallery method The gallery method is a way to display a large number of concepts simultaneously for discussion Sketches usually one concept to a sheet are taped or pinned to the walls of the meeting room Team members circulate and look at each concept The creator of the concept may offer explanation and the group subsequently makes suggestions for improving the concept or spontaneously generates related concepts This method is a good way to merge individual and group efforts In the a Russian problem solving methodology called a Russian acronym for theory of inventive problem solving began to be disseminated in Europe and in the United States The methodology is primarily useful in identifying physical working principles to solve technical problems The key idea underlying is to identify a contradiction that is implicit in a problem For example a contradiction in the nailer problem might be that increasing power a desirable characteristic would also tend to increase weight an undesirable characteristic One of the tools is a matrix of 39 by 39 characteristics with each cell corresponding to a particular conflict between two characteristics In each cell of the matrix up to four physical principles are suggested as ways of resolving the corresponding conflict There are 40 basic principles including for example the periodic action principle i e replace a continuous action with a periodic action like an impulse Using the nailer team might have arrived at the concept of using repeated smaller impacts to drive the nail The idea of identifying a conflict in the design problem and then thinking about ways to resolve the conflict appears to be a very useful problem solving heuristic This approach can be useful in generating concepts even without adopting the entire methodology Exhibit 7 6 shows some of the solutions the nailer team generated for the subproblems of l storing or accepting energy and 2 delivering translational energy to a nail Step 4 Explore Systematically As a result of the external and internal search activities the team will have collected tens or hundreds of concept fragments solutions to the subproblems Systematic exploration is aimed at navigating the space of possibilities by organizing and synthesizing these solution fragments The nailer team focused on the energy storage conversion and delivery subproblems and had generated dozens of concept fragments for each subproblem One approach to organizing and synthesizing these fragments would be to consider all of Generation 131 l 7 6 Solutions to Subproblem 0

fragments associated with each subproblem however a little arithmetic reveals the impossibility of this approach Given the three subproblems on which the team focused and an average of 15 fragments for each subproblem the team would have to consider 3 375 combinations of fragments 15 X 15 X 15 This would be a daunting task for even the most enthusiastic team Furthermore the team would quickly discover that many of the combinations do not even make sense Fortunately there are two specific tools for managing this complexity and organizing the thinking of the team the concept classification tree and the concept combination table The classification tree helps the team divide the possible solutions into independent categories The combination table guides the team in selectively considering combinations of fragments 132 Chapter 7 EXHIBIT 7 7 A classification tree for the nailer energy source concept fragments Fuel Air Systems Chemical Explosive Systems Pneumatic Store or Accept Energy Hydraulic Wall Outlet Battery Electrical Fuel Cell Nuclear Concept Classification Tree The concept classification tree is used to divide the entire space of possible solutions into several distinct classes that will facilitate comparison and pruning An example of a tree for the nailer example is shown in Exhibit 7 7 The branches of this tree correspond to different energy sources The classification tree provides at least four important benefits 1 Pruning of less promising branches If by studying the classification tree the team is able to identify a solution approach that does not appear to have much merit then this approach can be pruned and the team can focus its attention on the more promising branches of the tree Pruning a branch of the tree requires some evaluation and judgment and should therefore be done carefully but the reality of product development is that there are limited resources and that focusing the available resources on the most promising directions is an important success factor For the nailer team the nuclear energy source was pruned from consideration Although the team had identified some very intriguing nuclear devices for use in powering artificial hearts they felt that these devices would not be economically practical for at least a decade and would probably be hampered by regulatory requirements indefinitely EXHIBIT 7 8 A new problem decomposition assuming an electrical energy source and the accumulation of energy in the mechanical domain Concept Generation 133 Electrical Convert Apply Energy Energy Energy to Translational Nail I Translational rag I Energy I Energy e to Nail 2 Identification of independent approaches to the problem Each branch of the tree can be considered a different approach to solving the overall problem Some of these approaches may be almost completely independent of each other In these cases the team can cleanly divide its efforts among two or more individuals or task forces When two approaches both look promising this division of effort can reduce the complexity of the concept generation activities It also may engender some healthy competition among the approaches under consideration The nailer team found that both the chemical explosive branch and the electrical branch appeared quite promising They assigned these two approaches to two different and pursued them independently for several weeks 3 Exposure of inappropriate emphasis on certain branches Once the tree is constructed the team is able to reflect quickly on whether the effort applied to each branch has been appropriately allocated The nailer team recognized that they had applied very little effort to thinking about hydraulic energy sources and conversion technologies This recognition guided them to focus on this branch of the tree for a few days 4 Refinement of the problem decomposition for a particular branch Sometimes a problem decomposition can be usefully tailored to a particular approach to the problem Consider the branch of the tree corresponding to the electrical energy source Based on additional investigation of the nailing process the team determined that the instantaneous power delivered during the nailing process was about 10 000 watts for a few milliseconds and so exceeds the power that is available from a wall outlet a battery or a fuel cell of reasonable size cost and mass They concluded therefore that energy must be accumulated over a substantial period of the nailing cycle say 100 milliseconds and then suddenly released to supply the required instantaneous power to drive the nail This quick analysis led the team to add a accumulate translational energy to their function diagram see Exhibit 7 8 They chose to add the after the conversion of electrical energy to mechanical energy but briefly considered the possibility of accumulating the energy in the electrical domain with a capacitor This kind of refinement of the function diagram is quite common as the team makes more assumptions about the approach and as more information is gathered The classification tree in Exhibit 7 7 shows the alternative solutions to the energy source subproblem However there are other possible trees The team might have chosen to use a tree classifying the alternative solutions to the energy delivery subproblem showing branches for single impact multiple impacts or pushing Trees can be constructed with branches corresponding to the solution fragments of any of the subproblems but certain classifications are more useful In general a subproblem whose solution highly constrains the possible solutions to the remaining subproblems is a good candidate for a classification tree For example the choice of energy source electrical nuclear pneumatic etc constrains whether a motor or a piston cylinder can be used to convert the energy to translational energy In contrast the choice of energy delivery mechanism single impact 134 Chapter 7 Convert Apply Electrical Energy to Accumulate Translational Translational Energy Energy Energy to Nail Rotary motor with transmission Spring Single impact Linear motor Moving mass Multiple impacts Solenoid Push nail Rail gun EXHIBIT 7 9 Concept combination table for the nailer multiple impacts etc does not greatly constrain the solutions to the other subproblems Reflection on which subproblem is likely to most highly constrain the solutions to the remaining subproblems will usually lead to one or two clear ways to construct the classification tree Concept Combination Table The concept combination table provides a way to consider combinations of solution fragments systematically Exhibit 7 9 shows an example of a combination table that the nailer team used to consider the combinations of fragments for the electrical branch of the classification tree The columns in the table correspond to the subproblems identified in Exhibit 7 8 The entries in each column correspond to the solution fragments for each of these subproblems derived from external and internal search For example the subproblem of converting electrical energy to translational energy is the heading for the first column The entries in this column are a rotary motor with a transmission a linear motor a solenoid and a rail gun Potential solutions to the overall problem are formed by combining one fragment from each column For the nailer example there are 24 possible combinations 4 X 2 X 3 Choosing a combination of fragments does not lead spontaneously to a solution to the overall problem The combination of fragments must usually be developed and refined before an integrated solution emerges This development may not even be possible or may lead to more than one solution but at a minimum it involves additional creative thought In some ways the combination table is simply a way to make forced associations among fragments in order to stimulate further creative thinking in no way does the mere act of selecting a combination yield a complete solution Concept Generation 135 Convert Apply Electrical Energy to Accumulate Translational Translational Energy Energy Energy to Nail Rotary motor with Sin act g p Linear motor Multiple

the fragments rotary motor with 99 6 spring and single impact Exhibit 7 12 shows a sketch of a concept arising 99 S from the combination of rotary motor with transmission spring and multiple impacts

arising from the combination of a motor with transmission a spring and single impact The motor winds a spring accumulating potential energy that is then delivered to the nail in a single blow Two guidelines make the concept combination process easier First if a fragment can be eliminated as being infeasible before combining it with other fragments then the number of combinations the team needs to consider is dramatically reduced For example if the team could determine that the rail gun would not be feasible under any condition they could reduce the number of combinations from 24 to 18 Second the concept combination table should be concentrated on the subproblems that are coupled Coupled subproblems are those whose solutions can be evaluated only in combination with the solutions to other subproblems For example the choice of the specific electrical energy source to be Generation 137 Convert Apply Electrical Energy to Accumulate Translational Translational Energy Energy Energy to

impacts The motor repeatedly winds and releases the spring storing and delivering energy over several blows e g battery versus wall outlet although extremely critical is somewhat independent of the choice of energy conversion e g motor versus solenoid Therefore the concept combination table does not need to contain a column for the different types of electrical energy sources This reduces the number of combinations the team must consider As a practical matter concept combination tables lose their usefulness when the number of columns exceeds three or four Managing the Exploration Process The classification tree and combination tables are tools that a team can use somewhat flexibly They are simple ways to organize thinking and guide the creative energies of the team Rarely do teams generate only one classification tree and one concept combination table More typically the team will create several alternative classification trees and Chapter 7 Convert Apply Electrical Energy to

Solutions from the combination of a linear motor a moving mass and single impact A linear motor accelerates a massive hammer accumulating kinetic energy that is delivered to the nail in a single blow concept combination tables Interspersed with this exploratory activity may be a refining of the original problem decomposition or the pursuit of additional internal or external search The exploration step of concept generation usually acts more as a guide for further creative thinking than as the final step in the process Recall that at the beginning of the process the team chooses a few subproblems on which to focus attention Eventually the team must return to address all of the subproblems This usually occurs after the team has narrowed the range of alternatives for the critical subproblems The nailer team narrowed its alternatives to a few chemical and a few electric concepts and then refined them by working out the user interface industrial design and configuration issues One of the resulting concept descriptions is shown in Exhibit 7 14 EXHIBIT 7 1 4 One of several refined solution concepts Concept Generation 139 Courtesy of Product Genesis Inc Step 5 Reflect on the Solutions and the Process Although the reflection step is placed here at the end for convenience in presentation reflection should in fact be performed throughout the whole process Questions to ask include Is the team developing confidence that the solution space has been fully explored Are there alternative function diagrams Are there alternative ways to decompose the problem Have external sources been thoroughly pursued Have ideas from everyone been accepted and integrated in the process The nailer team members discussed whether they had focused too much attention on the energy storage and conversion issues in the tool while ignoring the user interface and overall configuration They decided that the energy issues remained at the core of the problem and that their decision to focus on these issues first was justified They also wondered if they had pursued too many branches of the classification tree Initially they had pursued electrical chemical and pneumatic concepts before ultimately settling on an electric concept In hindsight the chemical approach had some obvious safety and customer perception shortcomings they were exploring the use of explosives as an energy source They decided that although they liked some aspects of the chemical solution they should have eliminated it from consideration earlier in the process allowing more time to pursue some of the more promising branches in greater detail 140 Chapter 7 The team explored several of these concepts in more detail and built working prototypes of incorporating two fundamentally different directions 1 a motor winding a spring with energy released in a single blow and 2 a motor with a rotating mass that repeatedly hit the nail at a rate of about 10 cycles per second until the nail was fully driven Ultimately the tool proved to be the most technically feasible approach and the final product Exhibit 7 1 was based on this concept Summary A product concept is an approximate description of the technology working principles and form of the product The degree to which a product satisfies customers and can be successfully commercialized depends to a large measure on the quality of the underlying concept The concept generation process begins with a set of customer needs and target specifications and results in a set of product concepts from which the team will make a final selection In most cases an effective development team will generate hundreds of concepts of which 5 to 20 will merit serious consideration during the subsequent concept selection activity 0 The concept generation method presented in this chapter consists of five steps 1 Clarify the problem Understand the problem and decompose it into simpler subproblems 2 Search externally Gather information from lead users experts patents published literature and related products 3 Search internally Use individual and group methods to retrieve and adapt the knowledge of the team 4 Explore systematically Use classification trees and combination tables to organize the thinking of the team and to synthesize solution fragments 5 Reflect on the solutions and the process Identify opportunities for improvement in subsequent iterations or future projects 0 Although concept generation is an inherently creative process teams can benefit from using a structured method Such an approach allows full exploration of the design space and reduces the chance of oversight in the types of solution concepts considered It also acts as a map for those team members who are less experienced in design problem solving 0 Despite the linear presentation of the concept generation process in this chapter the team will likely return to each step of the process several times Iteration is particularly common when the team is developing a radically new product Professionals who are good at concept generation seem to always be in great demand as team members Contrary to popular opinion we believe concept generation is a skill that can be learned and developed Concept Generation 141 References and Bibliography Many current resources are available on the Internet via u rich net and were the driving force behind

prospects for computer support for concept generation activities Can you think of any computer tools that would be especially helpful in this process What would be the relative advantages and disadvantages of involving actual customers in the concept generation process For what types of products would the initial focus of the concept generation activity be on the form and user interface of

new concepts for the problem of dealing with leaves on a lawn How would a plastic bag manufacturer s assumptions and problem decomposition differ from those of a manufacturer of lawn tools and equipment and from those of a company responsible for maintaining golf courses around the world Should the context of the firm dictate the way concept generation is approached CHAPTER EIGHT Concept Selection Courtesy of Pharmaceuticals Inc EXHIBIT 8 1 One of the existing outpatient syringes 143144 Chapter 8 A medical supply company retained a product design firm to develop a reusable syringe with precise dosage control for outpatient use One of the products sold by a competitor is shown in Exhibit 8 1 To focus the development effort the medical supply company identified two major problems with its current product cost the existing model was made of stainless steel and accuracy of dose metering The company also requested that the product be tailored to the physical capabilities of the elderly an important segment of the target market To summarize the needs of its client and of the intended end users the team established seven criteria on which the choice of a product concept would be based Ease of handling 0 Ease of use 0 Readability of dose settings 0 Dose metering accuracy 0 Durability 0 Ease of manufacture Portability The team described the concepts under consideration with the sketches shown in Exhibit 8 3 Although each concept nominally satisfied the key customer needs the team was faced with choosing the best concept for further design refinement and production The need to select one syringe concept from many raises several questions How can the team choose the best concept given that the designs are still quite abstract How can a decision be made that is embraced by the whole team How can desirable attributes of otherwise weak concepts be identified and used 0 How can the decision making process be documented This chapter uses the syringe example to present a concept selection methodology addressing these and other issues Concept Selection Is an Integral Part of the Product Development Process Early in the development process the product development team identifies a set of customer needs By using a variety of methods the team then generates alternative solution concepts in response to these needs See Chapter 5 Identifying Customer Needs and Chapter 7 Concept Generation for more detail on these activities Concept selection is the process of evaluating concepts with respect to customer needs and other criteria comparing the relative strengths and weaknesses of the concepts and selecting one or more concepts for further investigation testing or development Exhibit 8 2 illustrates how the concept selection activity is related to the other activities that make up the concept development phase of the product development process Although this chapter focuses on the selection of an overall product concept at the beginning of the development process the method we present is also useful later in the development process when the team must select subsystem concepts components and production processes Concept Selection 1 45 4 4 1 1 4 1 4 Mission Development Statement Identify Establish Generate Select Test Set Plan Plan Customer Target Product Product Product Final Downstream Needs Specifications Concepts Concept s Concept s Specifications Development Perform Economic Analysis Benchmark Competitive Products Build Models and Prototypes EXHIBIT 8 2 Concept selection is part of the overall concept development phase While many stages of the development process benefit from unbounded creativity and divergent thinking concept selection is the process of narrowing the set of concept alternatives under consideration Although concept selection is a convergent process it is frequently iterative and may not produce a dominant concept immediately A large set of concepts is initially winnowed down to a smaller set but these concepts may subsequently be combined and improved to temporarily enlarge the set of concepts under consideration Through several iterations a dominant concept is finally chosen Exhibit 8 4 illustrates the successive narrowing and temporary widening of the set of options under consideration during the concept selection activity All Teams Use Some Method for Choosing a Concept Whether or not the concept selection process is explicit all teams use some method to choose among concepts Even those teams generating only one concept are using a method choosing the first concept they think of The methods vary in their effectiveness and include the following External decision Concepts are turned over to the customer client or some other external entity for selection 0 Product champion An influential member of the product development team chooses a concept based on personal preference Intuition The concept is chosen by its feel Explicit criteria or trade offs are not used The concept just seems better Each member of the team votes for several concepts The concept with the most votes is selected Web based survey Using an survey tool each concept is rated by many people to find the best ones 0 Pros and cons The team lists the strengths and weaknesses of each concept and makes a choice based upon group opinion Prototype and test The organization builds and tests prototypes of each concept making a selection based upon test data Decision matrices The team rates each concept against selection criteria which may be weighted 146 Chapter 8 9 b MW 553 11 E NW

iterative process closely related to concept generation and testing The concept screening and scoring methods help the team refine and improve the concepts leading to one or more promising concepts upon which further testing and development activities will be focused The concept selection method in this chapter is built around the use of decision matrices for evaluating each concept with respect to a set of selection criteria A Structured Method Offers Several Benefits All of the front end activities of product development have tremendous influence on eventual product success Certainly the response of the market to a product depends critically on the product concept but many practitioners and researchers also believe that the choice of a product concept dramatically constrains the eventual manufacturing cost of the product A structured concept selection process helps to maintain objectivity throughout the concept phase of the development process and guides the product development team through a critical difficult and sometimes emotional process Specifically a structured concept selection method offers the following potential benefits A customer focused product Because concepts are explicitly evaluated against customer oriented criteria the selected concept is likely to be focused on the customer A competitive design By benchmarking concepts with respect to existing designs designers push the design to match or exceed their competitors performance along key dimensions Concept Selection 1 49 Better product process coordination Explicit evaluation of the product with respect to manufacturing criteria improves the product s and helps to match the product with the process capabilities of the firm Reduced time to product introduction A structured method becomes a common language among design engineers manufacturing engineers industrial designers marketers and project managers resulting in decreased ambiguity faster communication and fewer false starts Effective group decision making Within the development team organizational philosophy and guidelines willingness of members to participate and team member experience may constrain the concept selection process A structured method encourages decision making based on objective criteria and minimizes the likelihood that arbitrary or personal factors influence the product concept Documentation of the decision process A structured method results in a readily understood archive of the rationale behind concept decisions This record is useful for assimilating new team members and for quickly assessing the impact of changes in the customer needs or in the available alternatives Overview of Methodology We present a two stage concept selection methodology although the first stage may suffice for simple design decisions The first stage is called concept screening and the second stage is called concept scoring Each is supported by a decision matrix that is used by the team to rate rank and select the best concept s Although the method is structured we emphasize the role of group insight to improve and combine concepts Concept selection is often performed in two stages as a way to manage the complexity of evaluating dozens of product concepts The application of these two methods is illustrated in Exhibit 8 4 Screening is a quick approximate evaluation aimed at producing a few viable alternatives Scoring is a more careful analysis of these relatively few concepts in order to choose the single concept most likely to lead to product success During concept screening rough initial concepts are evaluated relative to a common reference concept using the screening matrix At this preliminary stage detailed quantitative comparisons are difficult to obtain and may be misleading so a coarse comparative rating system is used After some alternatives are eliminated the team may choose to move on to concept scoring and conduct more detailed analyses and finer quantitative evaluation of the remaining concepts using the scoring matrix as a guide Throughout the screening and scoring process several iterations may be performed with new alternatives arising from the combination of the features of several concepts Exhibits 8 5 and 8 7 illustrate the screening and scoring matrices using the selection criteria and concepts from the syringe example Both stages concept screening and concept scoring follow a six step process that leads the team through the concept selection activity The steps are 1 Prepare the selection matrix 2 Rate the concepts 3 Rank the concepts 4 Combine and improve the concepts 150 Chapter 8 5 Select one or more concepts 6 Reflect on the results and the process Although we present a well defined process the team not the method creates the concepts and makes the decisions that determine the quality of the product Ideally teams are made up of people from different functional groups within the organization Each member brings unique views that increase the understanding of the problem and thus facilitate the development of a successful customer oriented product The concept selection method exploits the matrices as visual guides for consensus building among team members The matrices focus attention on the customer needs and other decision criteria and on the product concepts for explicit evaluation improvement and selection Concept Screening Concept screening is based on a method developed by the late Stuart Pugh in the and is often called Pugh concept selection Pugh 1990 The purposes of this stage are to narrow the number of concepts quickly and to improve the concepts Exhibit 8 5 illustrates the screening matrix used during this stage Step 1 Prepare the Selection Matrix To prepare the matrix the team selects a physical medium appropriate to the problem at hand Individuals and small groups with a short list of criteria may use matrices on paper similar to Exhibit 8 5 or Appendix A for their selection process For larger groups a chalkboard or flip chart is desirable to facilitate group discussion Concepts A B C D E F G Master Rubber Reference Swash Lever Dial Selection Criteria Cylinder Brake Ratchet Plunge

syringe example the team rated the concepts against the reference concept using a simple code for better than 0 for same as i for worse than in order to identify some concepts for further consideration Note that the three concepts ranked 3 all received the same net score Concept Selection 1 51 Next the inputs concepts and criteria are entered on the matrix Although possibly generated by different individuals concepts should be presented at the same level of detail for meaningful comparison and unbiased selection The concepts are best portrayed by both a written description and a graphical representation A simple one page sketch of each concept greatly facilitates communication of the key features of the concept The concepts are entered along the top of the matrix using graphical or textual labels of some kind If the team is considering more than about 12 concepts the technique may be used to quickly choose the dozen or so concepts to be evaluated with the screening matrix is a technique in which members of the team simultaneously vote for three to five concepts by applying dots to the sheets describing their preferred concepts See Chapter 3 Opportunity Identification for a description of applied to a broad set of product opportunities The concepts with the most dots are chosen for concept screening It is also possible to use the screening matrix method with a large number of concepts This is facilitated by a spreadsheet and it is then useful to transpose the rows and Arrange the concepts in this case in the left column and the criteria along the top The selection criteria are listed along the left hand side of the screening matrix as shown in Exhibit 8 5 These criteria are chosen based on the customer needs the team has identified as well as on the needs of the enterprise such as low manufacturing cost or minimal risk of product liability The criteria at this stage are usually expressed at a fairly high level of abstraction and typically include from 5 to 10 dimensions The selection criteria should be chosen to differentiate among the concepts However because each criterion is given equal weight in the concept screening method the team should be careful not to list many relatively unimportant criteria in the screening matrix Otherwise the differences among the concepts relative to the more important criteria will not be clearly reflected in the outcome After careful consideration the team chooses a concept to become the benchmark or reference concept against which all other concepts are rated The reference is generally either an industry standard or a straightforward concept with which the team members are very familiar It can be a commercially available product a best in class benchmark product that the team has studied an earlier generation of the product any one of the concepts under consideration or a combination of subsystems assembled to represent the best features of different products Step 2 Rate the Concepts A relative score of better than same as 0 or worse than is placed in each cell of the matrix to represent how each concept rates in comparison to the reference concept relative to the particular criterion It is generally advisable to rate every concept on one criterion before moving to the next criterion However with a large number of concepts it is faster to use the opposite approach to rate each concept completely before moving on to the next concept Some people find the coarse nature of the relative ratings difficult to work with However at this stage in the design process each concept is only a general notion of the ultimate product and more detailed ratings are largely meaningless In fact given the imprecision of the concept descriptions at this point it is very difficult to consistently compare concepts to one another unless one concept the reference is consistently used as a basis for comparison 152 Chapter 8 When available objective metrics can be used as the basis for rating a concept For example a good approximation of assembly cost is the number of parts in a design Similarly a good approximation of ease of use is the number of operations required to use the device Such metrics help to minimize the subjective nature of the rating process Some objective metrics suitable for concept selection may arise from the process of establishing target specifications for the product See Chapter 6 Product Specifications for a discussion of metrics Absent objective metrics ratings are established by team consensus although secret ballot or other methods may also be useful At this point the team may also wish to note which selection criteria need further investigation and analysis Step 3 Rank the Concepts After rating all the concepts the team sums the number of better than same as and worse than scores and enters the sum for each category in the lower rows of the matrix From our example in Exhibit 8 5 concept A was rated to have two criteria better than five the same as and none worse than the reference concept Next a net score can be calculated by subtracting the number of worse than ratings from the better than ratings Once the summation is completed the team rank orders the concepts Obviously in general those concepts with more pluses and fewer minuses are ranked higher Often at this point the team can identify one or two criteria that really seem to differentiate the concepts Step 4 Combine and Improve the Concepts Having rated and ranked the concepts the team should verify that the results make sense and then consider if there are ways to combine and improve certain concepts Two issues to consider are Is there a generally good concept that is degraded by one bad feature Can a minor modification improve the overall concept and yet preserve a distinction from the other concepts Are there two concepts that can be combined to preserve the better than qualities while annulling the worse than qualities Combined and improved concepts are then added to the matrix rated by the team and ranked along with the original concepts In our example the team noticed that concepts D and F could be combined to remove several of the worse than ratings to yield a new concept to be considered in the next round Concept G was also considered for revision The team decided that this concept was too bulky so the excess storage space was removed while retaining the injection technique These revised concepts are shown in Exhibit 8 6 Step 5 Select One or More Concepts Once the team members are satisfied with their understanding of each concept and its relative quality they decide which concepts are to be selected for further refinement and analysis Based upon previous steps the team will likely develop a clear sense of which are the most promising concepts The number of concepts selected for further review will be limited by team resources personnel money and time In our example the team selected concepts A and E to be considered along with the revised concept G and the G Dial Screw Concept Lever Stop Concept Selection 1 53 RAM L I I L HA H N w AM W WW 19 wee 74512 W 1 49 505 NA ma II It EXHIBIT 8 6 New and revised concepts for the syringe During the selection process the syringe team revised concept G and generated a new concept arising from the combination of concepts D and F concept Having determined the concepts for further analysis the team must clarify which issues need to be investigated further before a final selection can be made The team must also decide whether another round of concept screening will be performed or whether concept scoring will be applied next If the screening matrix is not seen to provide sufficient resolution for the next step of evaluation and selection then the concept scoring stage with its weighted selection criteria and more detailed rating scheme would be used Step 6 Reflect on the Results and the Process All of the team members should be comfortable with the outcome If an individual is not in agreement with the decision of the team then perhaps one or more important criteria are missing from the screening matrix or perhaps a particular rating is in error or at least is not clear An explicit consideration of whether the results make sense to everyone reduces the likelihood of making a mistake and increases the likelihood that the entire team will be solidly committed to the subsequent development activities 154 Chapter 8 Concept A E G Reference Master Cylinder Lever Stop Swash Ring Dial Screw Selection

determine concept ranking While concept A serves as the overall reference concept the separate reference points for each criterion are signified by bold rating values Concept Scoring Concept scoring is used when increased resolution will better differentiate among competing concepts In this stage the team weighs the relative importance of the selection criteria and focuses on more refined comparisons with respect to each criterion The concept scores are determined by the weighted sum of the ratings Exhibit 8 7 illustrates the scoring matrix used in this stage In describing the concept scoring process we focus on the differences relative to concept screening Step 1 Prepare the Selection Matrix As in the screening stage the team prepares a matrix and identifies a reference concept In most cases a computer spreadsheet is the best format to facilitate ranking and sensitivity analysis The concepts that have been identified for analysis are entered on the top of the matrix The concepts have typically been refined to some extent since concept screening and may be expressed in more detail In conjunction with more detailed concepts the team may wish to add more detail to the selection criteria The use of hierarchical relations is a useful way to illuminate the criteria For the syringe example suppose the team decided that the criterion ease of use did not provide sufficient detail to help distinguish among the remaining concepts Ease of use could be broken down as shown in Exhibit 8 8 to include ease of injection ease of cleaning and ease of loading The level of criteria detail will depend upon the needs of the team it may not be necessary to expand the criteria at all If the team has created a hierarchical list of customer needs the secondary and tertiary needs are good candidates for more detailed selection criteria Selection 1 55 Ease of Injection EASE OF USE Ease of Cleaning Ease of Loading EXHIBIT 8 8 Hierarchical decomposition of selection criteria In conjunction with more detailed concepts the team may choose to break down criteria to the level of detail necessary for meaningful comparison Chapter 5 Identifying Customer Needs for an explanation of primary secondary and tertiary needs and see Appendixes A and B for examples of hierarchical selection criteria After the criteria are entered the team adds importance weights to the matrix Several different schemes can be used to weight the criteria such as assigning an importance value from 1 to 5 or allocating 100 percentage points among them as the team has done in Exhibit 8 7 There are marketing techniques for empirically determining weights from customer data and a thorough process of identifying customer needs may result in such weights Urban and Hauser 1993 However for the purpose of concept selection the weights are often determined subjectively by team consensus Step 2 Rate the Concepts As in the screening stage it is generally easiest for the team to focus its discussion by rating all of the concepts with respect to one criterion at a time Because of the need for additional resolution to distinguish among competing concepts a finer scale is now used We recommend a scale from 1 to 5 Relative Performance Rating Much worse than reference Worse than reference Same as reference Better than reference Much better than reference U A N Another scale such as 1 to 9 may certainly be used but finer scales generally require more time and effort A single reference concept can be used for the comparative ratings as in the screening stage however this is not always appropriate Unless by pure coincidence the reference concept is of average performance relative to all of the criteria the use of the same reference concept for the evaluation of each criterion will lead to scale compression for some of the criteria For example if the reference concept happens to be the easiest concept to manufacture all of the remaining concepts will receive an evaluation of 1 2 or 3 much worse than worse than or same as for the ease of manufacture criterion compressing the rating scale from five levels to three levels 156 Chapter 8 To avoid scale compression it is possible to use different reference points for the various selection criteria Reference points may come from several of the concepts under consideration from comparative benchmarking analysis from the target values of the product specifications or other means It is important that the reference point for each criterion be well understood to facilitate direct one to one comparisons Using multiple reference points does not prevent the team from designating one concept as the overall reference for the purposes of ensuring that the selected concept is competitive relative to this benchmark Under such conditions the overall reference concept will simply not receive a neutral score Exhibit 8 7 shows the scoring matrix for the syringe example The team believed that the master cylinder concept was not suitable as a reference point for two of the criteria and other concepts were used as reference points in these cases Appendix B illustrates a more detailed scoring matrix for which the team rated the concepts on each criterion with no explicit reference points These ratings were accomplished by discussing the merits of every concept with respect to one criterion at a time and arranging the scores on a 9 point scale Step 3 Rank the Concepts Once the ratings are entered for each concept weighted scores are calculated by multiplying the raw scores by the criteria weights The total score for each concept is the sum of the weighted scores n S 2 r w 1 i 1 11 I where raw rating of concept j for the criterion w weighting for criterion n number of criteria total score for concept j Finally each concept is given a rank corresponding to its total score as shown in Exhibit 8 7 Step 4 Combine and Improve the Concepts As in the screening stage the team looks for changes or combinations that improve concepts Although the formal concept generation process is typically completed before concept selection begins some of the most creative refinements and improvements occur during the concept selection process as the team realizes the inherent strengths and weaknesses of certain features of the product concepts Step 5 Select One or More Concepts The final selection is not simply a question of choosing the concept that achieves the highest ranking after the first pass through the process Rather the team should explore this initial evaluation by conducting a sensitivity analysis Using a computer spreadsheet the team can vary weights and ratings to determine their effect on the ranking Caveats Concept Selection 1 57 By investigating the sensitivity of the ranking to variations in a particular rating the team members can assess whether uncertainty about a particular rating has a large impact on their choice In some cases they may select a lower scoring concept about which there is little uncertainty instead of a higher scoring concept that may possibly prove unworkable or less desirable as they learn more about it Based on the selection matrix the team may decide to select the top two or more concepts These concepts may be further developed prototyped and tested to elicit customer feedback See Chapter 9 Concept Testing for a discussion of methods to assess customer response to product concepts The team may also create two or more scoring matrices with different weightings to yield the concept ranking for various market segments with different customer preferences It may be that one concept is dominant for several segments The team should also consider carefully the significance of differences in concept scores Given the resolution of the scoring system small differences are generally not significant For the syringe example the team agreed that concept was the most promising and would be likely to result in a successful product Step 6 Reflect on the Results and the Process As a final step the team reflects on the selected concept s and on the concept selection process In some ways this is the point of no return for the concept development process so everyone on the team should feel comfortable that all of the relevant issues have been discussed and that the selected concept s have the greatest potential to satisfy customers and be economically successful After each stage of concept selection it is a useful reality check for the team to review each of the concepts that are to be eliminated from further consideration If the team agrees that any of the dropped concepts is better overall than some of those retained then the source of this inconsistency should be identified Perhaps an important criterion is missing not weighted properly or inconsistently applied The organization can also benefit from reflection on the process itself Two questions are useful in improving the process for subsequent concept selection activities 0 In what way if at all did the concept selection method facilitate team decision making 0 How can the method be modified to improve team performance These questions focus the team on the strengths and weaknesses of the methodology in relation to the needs and capabilities of the organization With experience users of the concept selection methods will discover several subtleties Here we discuss some of these subtleties and point out a few areas for caution Decomposition of concept quality The basic theory underlying the concept selection method is that selection criteria and by implication customer needs can be evaluated independently and that concept quality is the sum of the qualities of the concept relative to each criterion The quality of some product concepts may not be easily decomposed into a set of independent criteria or the performance of the concept relative to the different criteria may be difficult to relate to overall concept quality For example the Chapter 8 appeal or performance of a tennis design may arise in a highly complex way from its weight ease of swinging shock transmission and energy absorption Simply choosing a concept based on the sum of performance relative to each criterion may fail to capture complex relationships among these criteria and 1993 discuss the problem of decision making including the issue of nonlinear relationships among selection criteria Subjective criteria Some selection criteria particularly those related to aesthetics are highly subjective Choices among alternatives based solely on subjective criteria must be made carefully In general the development team s collective judgment is not the best way to evaluate concepts on subjective dimensions Rather the team should narrow the alternatives to three or four and then solicit the opinions of representative customers from the target market for the product perhaps using mock ups or models to represent the concepts See Chapter 9 Concept Testing To facilitate improvement of concepts While discussing each concept to determine its rating the team may wish to make note of any outstanding positive or negative attributes of the concepts It is useful to identify any features that could be applied to other concepts as well as issues that could be addressed to improve the concept Notes may be placed directly in the cells of the selection matrix Such notes are particularly useful in step 4 when the team seeks to combine refine and improve the concepts before making a selection decision Where to include cost Most of the selection criteria are adaptations of the customer needs However ease of manufacturing and manufacturing cost are not customer needs The only reason customers care about manufacturing cost is that it establishes the lower bound on sale price Nevertheless cost is an extremely important factor in choosing a concept because it is one of the factors determining the economic success of the product For this reason we advocate the inclusion of some measure of cost or ease of manufacturing when evaluating concepts even though these measures are not true customer needs Similarly there may be needs of other stakeholders that were not expressed by actual customers but are important for economic success of the product Selecting elements of aggregate concepts Some product concepts are really aggregations of several simpler concepts If all of the concepts under consideration include choices from a set of simpler elements then the simple elements can be evaluated first and in an independent fashion before the more complex concepts are evaluated This sort of decomposition may follow partly from the structure used in concept generation For example if all of the syringes in our example could be used with all of several different needle types then the selection of a needle concept could be conducted independently of the selection of an overall syringe concept Applying concept selection throughout the development process Although throughout this chapter we have emphasized the application of the method to the selection of a basic product concept concept selection is used again and again at many levels of detail in the design and development process For example in the syringe example concept selection could be used at the very beginning of the development project to decide between a single use or multiple use approach Once the basic approach had been determined concept selection could be used to choose the basic product concept as illustrated in this chapter Finally concept selection could be used at the most detailed level of design for resolving decisions such as the choice of colors or materials Concept Selection 1 59 Summary Concept selection is the process of evaluating concepts with respect to customer needs and other criteria comparing the relative strengths and weaknesses of the concepts and selecting one or more concepts for further investigation or development All teams use some method implicit or explicit for selecting concepts Decision techniques employed for selecting concepts range from intuitive approaches to structured methods Successful design is facilitated by structured concept selection We recommend a process concept screening and concept scoring Concept screening uses a reference concept to evaluate concept variants against selection criteria Concept scoring may use different reference points for each criterion Concept screening uses a coarse comparison system to narrow the range of concepts under consideration Concept scoring uses weighted selection criteria and a finer rating scale Concept scoring may be skipped if concept screening produces a dominant concept Both screening and scoring use a matrix as the basis of a six step selection process The six steps are Prepare the selection matrix Rate the concepts Rank the concepts Combine and improve the concepts Select one or more concepts Reflect on the results and the process Concept selection is applied not only during concept development but throughout the subsequent design and development process Concept selection is a group

s electric scooter product concept 165166 Chapter 9 Mission Identify Customer Needs Development Plan Test Product Concept s Generate Product Concepts Establish Target Specification Set Final Specifications Plan Downstream Development Product Concept s Perform Economic Analysis Benchmark Competitive Products Build and Test Models and Prototypes EXHIBIT 9 2 Concept testing in relation to other concept development activities The Corporation a start up company had developed a new product concept to address the personal transportation market Exhibit 9 1 shows a photograph of a prototype of the product The concept was a three wheeled electric powered scooter that could be folded up and carried easily wished to assess the customer response to this concept in order to decide whether to proceed with its development and to support the company s financing efforts In this chapter we focus primarily on testing done during the concept development phase In a concept test the development team solicits a response to a description of the product concept from potential customers in the target market This type of testing may be used to select which of two or more concepts should be pursued to gather information from potential customers on how to improve a concept and to estimate the sales potential of the product Note that various other types of testing with potential customers may be completed at times other than during concept development For example some kind of customer test usually based on only a verbal description of a concept may be used in identifying the original product opportunity that forms the basis of the mission statement for the project A test may also be used to refine the demand forecast after the development of a product is nearly complete but before a firm commits to full production and launch Exhibit 9 2 shows concept testing relative to other concept development activities Concept testing is closely related to concept selection Chapter 8 in that both activities aim to further narrow the set of concepts under consideration However concept testing is distinct in that it is based on data gathered directly from potential customers and relies to a lesser degree on judgments made by the development team The reason that concept testing generally follows concept selection is that a team cannot feasibly test more than a few concepts directly with potential customers As a result the team must first narrow the set of alternatives under consideration to very few Concept testing is also closely related to prototyping Chapter 14 because concept testing invariably involves some kind of representation of the product concept often a prototype One of the end results of a concept test may be an estimate of how many units of the product the company is likely to sell This forecast is a key element of the information used in making an economic analysis of the product Chapter 17 A team may choose not to do any concept testing at all if the time required to test the concept is large relative to the product life cycles in the product category or if the cost of testing is large relative to the cost of actually launching the product For example in the Internet software business some observers and practitioners argue that just launching Testing 1 67 product and iteratively refining it with subsequent product generations is a better strategy than carefully testing a concept before developing it fully While perhaps appropriate for some products this strategy would be foolish in the development of for example a new commercial airplane where development costs and time are huge and failure can be disastrous Most product categories fall between these extremes and in most cases some form of concept testing is warranted This chapter presents a seven step method for testing product concepts Define the purpose of the concept test Choose a survey population Choose a survey format Communicate the concept Measure customer response Interpret the results Reflect on the results and the process We illustrate this method with the scooter example Step 1 Define the Purpose of the Concept Test As a first step in concept testing we recommend that the team explicitly articulate in writing the questions that the team wishes to answer with the test Concept testing is essentially an experimental activity and as with any experiment knowing the purpose of the experiment is essential to designing an effective experimental method This step is closely analogous to defining the purpose in prototyping See Chapter 14 Prototyping The primary questions addressed in concept testing are typically 0 Which of several alternative concepts should be pursued How can the concept be improved to better meet customer needs 0 Approximately how many units are likely to be sold Should development be continued Step 2 Choose a Survey Population An assumption underlying the concept test is that the population of potential customers surveyed reflects that of the target market for the product If the survey population is either more or less enthusiastic about the product than will be the eventual target audience for the product then inferences based on the concept test will be biased As a result the team should choose a survey population that mirrors the target market in as many ways as possible In the actual survey the first few questions are called the screener questions and generally are used to verify that the respondent fits the definition of the target market for the product Often a product addresses multiple market segments In such cases an accurate concept test requires that potential customers from each target segment be surveyed Surveying every possible segment may be prohibitively expensive in cost or time and Chapter 9 EXHIBIT 9 3 Factors leading to relatively smaller or larger survey sample sizes Factors Favoring a Smaller Factors Favoring a Larger Sample Size Sample Size Test occurs early in concept development Test occurs later in concept development process process Test is primarily intended to gather Test is primarily intended to assess demand qualitative data quantitatively Surveying potential customers is relatively Surveying customers is relatively fast and costly in time or money inexpensive Required investment to develop and launch Required investment to develop and launch the product is relatively small the product is relatively high A relatively large fraction of the target A relatively small fraction of the target market is expected to value the product market is expected to value the product i e i e many positively inclined respondents many people have to be sampled to reliably can be found without a large sample estimate the fraction that values the product such cases the team may choose to survey potential customers from only the largest segment However when only one segment is sampled inferences about the response of the entire market are likely to be biased For the scooter there were two primary consumer segments college students and urban commuters The team decided to form a survey population from both segments The team had also identified several smaller secondary segments including transportation for factory and airport employees The sample size of the survey should be large enough that the team s confidence in the results is high enough to guide decision making Sample sizes for concept testing are sometimes as small as 10 e g when gathering qualitative feedback on a new surgical device for a highly specialized procedure or as large as 1 000 e g when trying to quantitatively assess the potential demand for a new portable telephone that is targeted at a market segment comprising 10 million households Although there are no simple formulas for determining sample size some of the factors driving sample size are shown in Exhibit 9 3 Depending on the desired data to be collected from the concept testing process the team may actually structure multiple surveys with different objectives Each of these surveys may involve a different sample population and a different sample size The team performed two different concept tests In early concept testing the team sampled only a dozen or so potential customers to solicit feedback on the attractiveness of the basic concept Later the team performed a purchase intent survey of 1 000 customers This survey was used to make a demand forecast on which financing decisions were based Because of the importance of this objective the team felt that the time and expense associated with such a large sample were justified Step 3 Choose a Survey Format The following formats are commonly used in concept testing Face to face interaction In this format an interviewer interacts directly with the respondent Face to face interactions can take the form of intercepts i e stopping people at a mall in a park or on a city street interviews prearranged by telephone Concept Testing 1 69 interviews with potential customers at a trade show booth or focus groups i e prearranged group discussions with 6 12 people Telephone Telephone interviews may be prearranged and targeted at very specific individuals e g pediatric dentists or may be cold calls of consumers from a target population Postal mail In mail surveys concept testing materials are sent and respondents are asked to return a completed form Postal surveys are somewhat slower than other methods and suffer from relatively poor response rates Some kind of incentive often cash or a gift is sometimes offered to increase response Electronic mail Electronic mail surveys are very similar to postal mail surveys except that as of this writing respondents seem slightly more likely to reply than via postal mail With the proliferation of unwanted e mail this tendency may not persist Many electronic mail users react extremely negatively to unsolicited commercial correspondence We therefore recommend that electronic mail surveys be used only when respondents are likely to perceive a benefit to their participation or when the team has already established some kind of positive relationship with the target population Internet Using the Internet a team may create a virtual concept testing site in which survey participants can observe concepts and provide responses An electronic mail message is usually used to recruit respondents to visit the test site Each of these formats presents risks of sample bias For example the use of electronic formats may bias the sample toward those who are technologically sophisticated For some products this sophistication is part of the profile of the target market e g the target market for Internet software products is likely to be comfortable with electronic survey formats Conversely an Internet survey might be a particularly bad format for testing a television based computer concept targeted at people without personal computers Exploratory testing typical in the early phases of concept development benefits from open ended interactive formats We recommend that the team use face to face formats when presenting multiple concept alternatives or when soliciting ideas for improving a concept In these settings the product developers themselves benefit from performing the interviews because they can directly observe reactions to the product in rich detail As the purpose of the concept test becomes more focused more structured formats such as mail and telephone become more appropriate If the questions are very focused the team can hire a market research firm to implement the concept test When gathering data intended primarily for use in forecasting demand third parties are generally used to collect the data in face to face formats This helps to avoid a sympathy bias respondents indicating that they like the concept in order to please an anxious product developer Step 4 Communicate the Concept The choice of survey format is closely linked to the way in which the concept will be communicated Concepts can be communicated in any of the following ways listed in order of increasing richness of the description Verbal description A verbal description is generally a short paragraph or a collection of bullet points summarizing the product concept This description may be Chapter 9 EXHIBIT 9 4 Sketch of scooter concept Sketch by David Wallace by the respondent or may be read aloud by the person administering the survey For example the scooter concept might be described as follows The product is a lightweight electric scooter that can be easily folded and taken with you inside a building or on public transportation The scooter weighs about 25 pounds It travels at speeds up to 15 miles per hour and can go about 12 miles on a single charge The scooter can be recharged in about two hours from a standard electric outlet The scooter is easy to ride and has simple an accelerator button and a brake Sketch Sketches are usually line drawings showing the product in perspective perhaps with annotations of key features Exhibit 9 4 shows a sketch of the scooter concept Photos and renderings Photographs can be used to communicate the concept when appearance models exist for the product concept Renderings are nearly photo realistic illustrations of the concept Renderings can be created with pens and markers or using computer aided design tools Exhibit 9 5 shows a rendering of the scooter created using computer aided design software Storyboard A storyboard is a series of images that communicates a temporal sequence of actions involving the product For example one of the potential benefits of the scooter is that it can be easily stored and transported This scenario is illustrated in the storyboard in Exhibit 9 6 Video Video images allow even more dynamism than the storyboard With Video the form of the product itself can be clearly communicated as can the way in which the product is used The scooter team used a video in its purchase intent survey 9 5 Rendering of the scooter from computer aided design software EXHIBIT 9 6 Storyboard illustrating storage transportation and use scenarios Concept Testing 1 71 compact storage portable transportation Courtesy of Corporation reduced am transit Courtesy of Chapter 9 EXHIBIT 9 7 Appearance model of the scooter concept Courtesy of Corporation video showed students and commuters riding prototypes of the product and showed an animation of the folding mechanism Simulation Simulation is generally implemented as software that mimics the function or interactive features of the product Simulation would probably not be the ideal way to communicate the key features of a scooter but in some other cases simulation can be effective For example in testing controls for electronic devices a visual image of the vice can be created on the computer screen and the user can control the simulated device via a touch screen or mouse clicks and can observe simulated displays and sounds Interactive multimedia Interactive multimedia combines the visual richness of video with the interactivity of simulation Using multimedia you can display video and still images of the product The respondent can view verbal and graphical information and can listen to audio information Interaction allows the respondent to choose from among several sources of available information on the product and in some cases to experience the controls and displays of a simulated product Unfortunately the development of multimedia systems remains expensive and therefore may be justified only for large product development efforts Physical appearance models Physical appearance models also known as looks like models vividly display the form and appearance of a product They are often made of wood or polymer foams and are painted to look like real products In some cases limited functionality is included in the model The scooter team built several looks like models one of which was articulated so that the folding feature could be demonstrated Exhibit 9 7 shows a photograph of this model EXHIBIT 9 8 Working prototype of the scooter concept Concept Testing 1 73 Courtesy of Corporation Working prototypes When available working prototypes or works like models can be useful in concept testing However the use of working prototypes is also risky The primary risk is that the respondents will equate the prototype with the finished product In some cases prototypes perform better than the ultimate product e g because the prototype uses better more expensive components such as motors or batteries In most cases the prototype performs worse than the ultimate product and is almost always less visually attractive than the ultimate product Sometimes separate works like and looks like prototypes can be used one to illustrate how the product will appear in production and the other to illustrate how it would work Exhibit 9 8 shows a working prototype of the scooter which was used in some early concept testing Matching the Survey Format with the Means of Communicating the Concept The choice of survey format is tightly linked to the means of communicating the product concept For example the team obviously cannot demonstrate the scooter with a working model using a telephone survey Exhibit 9 9 identifies which means of communicating concepts are appropriate for each survey format Issues in Communicating the Concept When communicating the product concept the team must decide how aggressively to promote the product and its benefits The scooter could be described as an personal mobility device or as an exciting new electric scooter that Chapter 9 EXHIBIT 9 9 Appropriateness of different survey formats for different ways of communicating the product concept Electronic Postal Face Mail Mail Internet Face Verbal description Sketch Photo or rendering Storyboard Video Simulation Interactive multimedia Physical appearance model Working prototype freedom from gridlock In our view the description of the concept should closely mirror the information that the user is likely to consider when making a purchase decision If highly promotional information is used it can be labeled as a sample advertisement perhaps supplemented by mock ups of magazine articles or comments by current owners providing additional descriptions of the product Researchers and practitioners argue endlessly about whether the purchase price of the product should be included as part of the concept description Price is a very powerful lever on customer response and therefore pricing information can dramatically influence the results of a concept test We recommend that price be omitted from the concept description unless the price of the product is expected to be unusually high or low For example the primary benefit of a concept may be that it provides basic functionality at a very low price In this case price must be included as part of the concept description Conversely a product may provide extremely high performance or unique features but only at a relatively high price In this case price must also be included as part of the concept description When the price of the product is likely to be quite similar to existing products and to customer expectations price can be omitted from the concept description Instead of including price in the concept description we suggest that the respondent be asked explicitly what his or her expectation of price would be If the resulting customer expectations differ substantially from the team s pricing plans then the team may need to either consider modifications to the concept or repeat the concept test including price as a product attribute Because the scooter was a new product category for which customers had not developed clear pricing expectations the team chose to include their target price as part of the concept description Instead of showing a single concept the team may choose to ask a respondent to select from several alternatives This approach is attractive when the team is trying to decide among several concepts under consideration A variant on this approach is to present the concept for the new product along with descriptions and pictures of the most successful existing products This approach has the advantage of allowing respondents to directly assess attributes of the product concept in comparison to those of competitors Assuming the products would be equally distributed and promoted this approach also allows the team to estimate potential market share Using a forced choice survey technique is likely to be most effective in cases for which there is a narrowly defined product category with relatively few existing products Concept Testing 1 75 Step 5 Measure Customer Response Most concept test surveys first communicate the product concept and then measure customer response When a concept test is performed early in the concept development phase customer response is usually measured by asking the respondent to choose from two or more alternative concepts Additional questions focus on why respondents react the way they do and on how the product concepts could be improved Concept tests also generally attempt to measure purchase intent The most commonly used purchase intent scale has five response categories 0 Definitely would buy 0 Probably would buy 0 Might or might not buy 0 Probably would not buy 0 Definitely would not buy There are many alternatives to this scale including providing seven or more response categories or asking respondents to indicate a numerical probability of purchase Exhibit 9 10 shows an example of a survey form for the scooter This form was designed to be an interview guide for a face to face format in which both a brochure and a working prototype were used to communicate the product concept Step 6 Interpret the Results If the team is simply interested in comparing two or more concepts interpretation of the results is straightforward If one concept dominates the others and the team is confident that the respondents understood the key differences among the concepts then the team can simply choose the preferred concept If the results are not conclusive the team may decide to choose a concept based on cost or other considerations or may decide to offer multiple versions of the product Note that care must be applied in making this judgment for cases in which manufacturing costs are dramatically different among the concepts under comparison and in which no price information is communicated to the respondents In such cases respondents may be biased to select the most costly alternative In many cases the team is also interested in estimating the demand for a product in the period following launch usually one year Here we present a model for estimating the sales potential of durables By durables we mean products that last several years and for which there is therefore a negligible repeat purchase rate These products are in contrast to consumer packaged goods like razor blades toothpaste or frozen food for which forecasting models must consider rates of trial and subsequent repeat purchase Before proceeding with the model we note that forecasting sales of new products is subject to a great deal of uncertainty and exhibits notoriously high errors Nevertheless forecasts do tend to be correlated with actual demand and so provide useful information to the team We estimate Q the quantity of the product expected to be sold during a time period as Q N A Chapter

Ask open ended questions to elicit feedback on the concept EXHIBIT 9 1 0 Example interview guide abridged for a concept test of the electric scooter N is the number of potential customers expected to make purchases during the time period For an existing and stable product category e g bicycles N is the expected number of purchases to be made of existing products in the category over the time period A is the fraction of these potential customers or purchases for which the product is available and the customer is aware of the product In situations where awareness and availability are assumed to be separate independent factors they are multiplied together to generate A P is the probability that the product is purchased if available and if the customer is aware of it P is estimated in turn by P X F definitely X F Testing 1 77 F definitely is the fraction of survey respondents indicating in the concept test survey that they would definitely purchase often called the top box score is the fraction of survey respondents indicating that they would probably purchase often called the second box score and are calibration constants usually established based on the experience of a company with similar products in the past Generally the values of and fall in these intervals 0 10 0 50 0 0 25 Absent prior history many teams use values of 0 4 and 0 2 Note that these values reflect the typical bias of respondents to overestimate the probability that they would actually purchase the product Among other possible schemes for estimating P is a function that includes the fraction of respondents in all of the response categories not just the top two For a product associated with an entirely new category e g portable commuter scooters the interpretation of these variables is slightly different In this case N is the number of customers in the target market for the new product and P is the probability of a customer purchasing the product within a given time period often a year Note that this interpretation is reflected in the survey questions in Exhibit 9 10 in which the respondent is asked to indicate the likelihood of purchase within the next year To clarify the model consider these two numerical examples corresponding to two different market segments and possible product for the scooter concept Scooter Sold as Single Person Transportation in Large Factories This is an existing category Assume that scooters are currently sold into this market at a rate of 150 000 units per year N 150 000 Assume that the company sells the product through a single distributor that accounts for 25 percent of the sales in this category A 0 25 Assume that results from a concept test with factory managers responsible for purchasing transportation devices indicate a definitely would buy fraction of 0 30 and probably fraction of 0 20 If we use a value of 0 4 for and 0 2 for then P 0 4 X 0 30 0 2 X 0 20 0 16 and Q 150 000 X 0 25 X 0 16 6 000 units year Scooter Sold to College Students This is a new category and therefore poses a much more difficult estimation challenge First what should be the value of N Strictly speaking as of this writing there are very few existing sales of electric scooters to college students However we could define N several other ways For example how many students purchase bicycles or motor scooters intended for basic transportation of up to two miles This number is approximately 1 million per year Alternatively how many students must travel distances of between one and three miles either in commuting from home or traveling between classes or other school activities This number is approximately 2 million Assume that we sample students in this second group and that we obtain a buy fraction of 0 10 and a probably would buy fraction of 0 05 Note that these numbers represent the fraction of respondents that indicate intent to purchase within one year Further assume that the company plans to sell the scooter through bicycle stores near campuses and advertise in campus newspapers for the 100 largest college campuses in the United States Based on this plan the company expects that 30 percent of the Chapter 9 in the target market will be aware of the product and have convenient access to a dealer If we use a value of 0 4 for and 0 2 for then P 0 4 X 0 10 0 2 X 0 05 0 05 and Q 2 000 000 X 0 30 X 0 05 30 000 units in the first year The results of forecasts based on concept testing should be interpreted with caution Some firms mostly after repeated experience with similar products have achieved impressive levels of accuracy in their forecasts While forecasts do tend to be correlated with actual sales most individual forecasts exhibit substantial errors Some of the factors that can cause actual purchase patterns to differ from the purchase intentions expressed in surveys include Importance of word of mouth When the benefits of a product are not immediately obvious the enthusiasm of existing users may be an important factor in generating demand This factor is not generally captured in concept testing Fidelity of the concept description If the actual product differs substantially from the description of the product in the concept test then actual sales are likely to differ from the forecast Pricing If the price of the product deviates substantially from the price indicated in the survey or from the expectations of survey respondents then forecasts are likely to be inaccurate Level of promotion Spending on advertising and other forms of promotion can increase demand for most products The influence of promotion is accounted for only weakly in the forecasting model via the awareness availability term and via the materials used to present the concept s Step 7 Reflect on the Results and the Process The primary benefit of the concept test is in getting feedback from real potential customers The qualitative insights gathered through open ended discussions with respondents about the proposed concepts may be the most important result of concept testing especially early in the development process The team should reflect on this evidence as well as on the numerical outcome of its forecast The team benefits from thinking about the impact of the three key variables in the forecasting model 1 the overall size of the market 2 the availability and awareness of the product and 3 the fraction of customers who are likely to purchase Considering alternative markets for the product can sometimes increase the first factor The second factor can be increased through distribution arrangements and promotion plans The third factor can be increased through changes to the product design and possibly advertising that improve the attractiveness of the product In considering these factors a sensitivity analysis can yield useful insights and aids in decision making For example what would be the impact on sales if the team were able to secure a partnership with a retailer and therefore increase A by 20 percent Concept Testing 1 79 In reflecting on the results of the concept test the team should ask two key diagnostic questions First was the concept communicated in a way that is likely to elicit customer response that reflects true intent For example if one of the primary benefits of the concept is its aesthetic appeal was the concept presented in a way that this aspect of the product was clear to respondents Second is the resulting forecast consistent with observed sales rates of similar products For example if only 1 000 gasoline powered scooters a competing product are currently sold to college students each year why does the team believe it will sell 30 times as many of its product Finally we note that experience with a new product is likely to be applicable to future similar products The team can benefit from its experience by documenting the results of its concept testing and by attempting to reconcile these results with subsequent observations of product success Summary A concept test solicits a direct response to a description of the product concept from potential customers in the target market Concept testing is distinct from concept selection in that it is based on data gathered directly from potential customers and relies to a lesser degree on judgments made by the development team Concept testing can verify that customer needs have been adequately met by the product concept assess the sales potential of a product concept and or gather customer information for refining the product concept 0 Concept testing is appropriate at several different points in the development process when identifying the original product opportunity when selecting which of two or more concepts should be pursued when assessing the sales potential of a product concept and or when deciding whether to continue further development and commercialization of the product We recommend a seven step method for testing product concepts Define the purpose of the concept test Choose a survey population Choose a survey format Communicate the concept Measure customer response Interpret the results O I Reflect on the

Architecture Courtesy of Hewlett Packard Company EXHIBIT 10 1 Three Hewlett Packard printers from the same product platform an office model a photo model and a model including scanning capability 1831 84 Chapter 10 A product development team within Hewlett Packard s home printing division was considering how to respond to the simultaneous pressures to increase product variety and to reduce manufacturing costs Several of the division s printer products are shown in Exhibit 10 1 Ink jet printing had become the dominant technology for consumer and small office printing involving color Excellent black and white print quality and color print quality could be obtained using a printer costing less than 200 Driven by the increasing value of color ink jet printers sales of the three leading competitors together were millions of units per year However as the market matured commercial success required that printers be tuned to the subtle needs of more focused market segments and that the manufacturing costs of these products be continually reduced In considering their next steps the team members asked How would the architecture of the product impact their ability to offer product variety What would be the cost implications of different product architectures How would the architecture of the product impact their ability to complete the design within 12 months 0 How would the architecture of the product influence their ability to manage the development process Product architecture is the assignment of the functional elements of a product to the physical building blocks of the product We focus this chapter on the task of establishing the product architecture The purpose of the product architecture is to define the basic physical building blocks of the product in terms of what they do and what their interfaces are to the rest of the device Architectural decisions allow the detailed design and testing of these building blocks to be assigned to teams individuals and or suppliers such that development of different portions of the product can be carried out simultaneously In the next two sections of this chapter we define product architecture and illustrate the profound implications of architectural decisions using as examples the printer and several other products We then present a method for establishing the product architecture and focus on the printer example for illustration Note that the details of the printer example have been somewhat disguised to preserve s proprietary product information After presenting the method we discuss the relationships among product architecture product variety and supply chain performance and we provide guidance for platform planning an activity closely linked to the product architecture What Is Product Architecture A product can be thought of in both functional and physical terms The functional elements of a product are the individual operations and transformations that contribute to the overall performance of the product For a printer some of the functional elements are store paper and communicate with host computer Functional elements are usually described in schematic form before they are reduced to specific technologies components or physical working principles The physical elements of a product are the parts components and that ultimately implement the product s functions The physical elements become 10 2 Two models of bicycle brake and shifting controls The product on the left exemplifies a modular architecture the product on the right has a more integral architecture Product Architecture 1 85 defined as development progresses Some physical elements are dictated by the product concept and others become defined during the detail design phase For example the embodies a product concept involving a thermal ink delivery device implemented by a print cartridge This physical element is inextricably linked to the product concept and was essentially an assumption of the development project The physical elements of a product are typically organized into several major physical building blocks which we call chunks Each chunk is then made up of a collection of components that implement the functions of the product The architecture of a product is the scheme by which the functional elements of the product are arranged into physical chunks and by which the chunks interact Perhaps the most important characteristic of a product s architecture is its modularity Consider the two different designs for bicycle braking and shifting controls shown in Exhibit 10 2 In the traditional design left the shift control function and the brake control function are allocated to separate chunks which in fact are mounted in separate locations on the bicycle This design exhibits a modular architecture In the design on the right the shift and brake control functions are allocated to the same chunk This design exhibits an integral architecture in this case motivated by aerodynamic and ergonomic concerns A modular architecture has the following two properties Chunks implement one or a few functional elements in their entirety The interactions between chunks are well defined and are generally fundamental to the primary functions of the product The most modular architecture is one in which each functional element of the product is implemented by exactly one physical chunk and in which there are a few well defined interactions between the chunks Such a modular architecture allows a design change to be made to one chunk without requiring a change to other chunks for the product to function correctly The chunks may also be designed quite independently of one another The opposite of a modular architecture is an integral architecture An integral architecture exhibits one or more of the following properties Courtesy of 86 Chapter 10 XIII 0 Functional elements of the product are implemented using more than one chunk 0 A single chunk implements many functional elements 0 The interactions between chunks are ill defined and may be incidental to the primary functions of the products A product embodying an integral architecture will often be designed with the highest possible performance in mind Implementation of functional elements may be distributed across multiple chunks Boundaries between the chunks may be difficult to identify or may be nonexistent Many functional elements may be combined into a few physical components to optimize certain dimensions of performance however modifications to any one particular component or feature may require extensive redesign of the product Modularity is a relative property of a product architecture Products are rarely strictly modular or integral Rather we can say that they exhibit either more or less modularity than a comparative product as in the brake and shift controls example in Exhibit 10 2 Types of Modularity Modular architectures comprise three types slot bus and sectional Ulrich 1995 Each type embodies a one to one mapping from functional elements to chunks and interfaces The differences between these types lie in the way the interactions between chunks are organized Exhibit 10 3 illustrates the conceptual differences among these types of architectures Slot modular architecture Each of the interfaces between chunks in a slot modular architecture is of a different type from the others so that the various chunks in the product cannot be interchanged An automobile radio is an example of a chunk in a slot modular architecture The radio implements exactly one function but its interface is different from any of the other components in the vehicle e g radios and speedometers have different types of interfaces to the instrument panel Bus modular architecture In a bus modular architecture there is a common bus to which the other chunks connect via the same type of interface A common example of a chunk in a bus modular architecture would be an expansion card for a personal computer products can also be built around a bus modular architecture Track lighting shelving systems with rails and adjustable roof racks for automobiles all embody a bus modular architecture Slot Modular Bus Modular Sectional Modular Architecture Architecture EXHIBIT 1 0 3 Three types of modular architectures Product Architecture 1 87 Sectional modular architecture In a sectional modular architecture all interfaces are of the same type but there is no single element to which all the other chunks attach The assembly is built up by connecting the chunks to each other via identical interfaces Many piping systems adhere to a sectional modular architecture as do sectional sofas office partitions and some computer systems Slot modular architectures are the most common of the modular architectures because for most products each chunk requires a different interface to accommodate unique interactions between that chunk and the rest of the product Bus modular and architectures are particularly useful for situations in which the overall product must vary widely in configuration but whose chunks can interact in standard ways with the rest of the product These situations can arise when all of the chunks can use the same type of power fluid connection structural attachment or exchanges of signals When Is the Product Architecture Defined A product s architecture begins to emerge during concept development This happens informally in the sketches function diagrams and early prototypes of the concept development phase Generally the maturity of the basic product technology dictates whether the product architecture is fully defined during concept development or during system level design When the new product is an incremental improvement on an existing product concept then the product architecture is defined within the product concept This is for two reasons First the basic technologies and working principles of the product are predefined and so conceptual design efforts are generally focused on better ways to embody the given concept Second as a product category matures supply chain i e production and distribution considerations and issues of product variety begin to become more prominent Product architecture is one of the development decisions that most impacts a firm s ability to efficiently deliver high product variety Architecture therefore becomes a central element of the product concept However when the new product is the first of its kind concept development is generally concerned with the basic working principles and technology on which the product will be based In this case the product architecture is often the initial focus of the system level design phase of development Implications of the Architecture Decisions about how to divide the product into chunks and about how much modularity to impose on the architecture are tightly linked to several issues of importance to the entire enterprise product change product variety component standardization product performance and product development management The architecture of the product therefore is closely linked to decisions about marketing strategy manufacturing capabilities and product development management Product Change Chunks are the physical building blocks of the product but the architecture of the product defines how these blocks relate to the function of the product The architecture therefore also defines how the product can be changed Modular chunks allow changes to be made to a few isolated functional elements of the product without necessarily Chapter 10 the design of other chunks Changing an integral chunk may influence many functional elements and require changes to several related chunks Some of the motives for product change are Upgrade As technological capabilities or user needs evolve some products can accommodate this evolution through upgrades Examples include changing the processor board in a computer printer or replacing a pump in a cooling system with a more powerful model Add ons Many products are sold by a manufacturer as a basic unit to which the user adds components often produced by third parties as needed This type of change is common in the personal computer industry e g third party mass storage devices may be added to a basic computer Adaptation Some long lived products may be used in several different use environments requiring adaptation For example machine tools may need to be converted from 220 volt to 110 volt power Some engines can be converted from a gasoline to a propane fuel supply Wear Physical elements of a product may deteriorate with use necessitating replacement of the worn components to extend the useful life of the product For example many razors allow dull blades to be replaced tires on vehicles can usually be replaced most rotational bearings can be replaced and many appliance motors can be replaced Consumption Some products consume materials which can then be easily replenished For example copiers and printers frequently contain print cartridges cameras take film cartridges glue guns consume glue sticks torches have gas cartridges and watches contain batteries all of which are generally replaceable Flexibility in use Some products can be configured by the user to provide different capabilities For example many cameras can be used with different lens and flash options some boats can be used with several awning options and fishing rods may accommodate several rod reel configurations Reuse In creating subsequent products the firm may wish to change only a few functional elements while retaining the rest of the product intact For example consumer electronics manufacturers may wish to update a product line by changing only the user interface and enclosure while retaining the inner workings from a previous model In each of these cases a modular architecture allows the firm to minimize the physical changes required to achieve a functional change Product Variety Variety refers to the range of product models the firm can produce within a particular time period in response to market demand Products built around modular product architectures can be more easily varied without adding tremendous complexity to the manufacturing system For example Swatch produces hundreds of different watch models but can achieve this variety at relatively low cost by assembling the variants from different combinations of standard chunks Exhibit 10 4 A large number of different hands faces and wristbands can be combined with a relatively small selection of movements and cases to create seemingly endless combinations EXHIBIT 10 4 Swatch uses a modular architecture to enable high variety manufacturing Product Architecture 1 89 Photo by Stuart Cohen Component Standardization Component standardization is the use of the same component or chunk in multiple products If a chunk implements only one or a few widely useful functional elements then the chunk can be standardized and used in several different products Such standardization allows the firm to manufacture the chunk in higher volumes than would otherwise be possible This in turn may lead to lower costs and increased quality For example the watch movement shown in Exhibit 10 4 is identical for many Swatch models Component standardization may also occur outside the firm when several manufacturers products all use a chunk or component from the same supplier For example the watch battery shown in Exhibit 10 4 is made by a supplier and standardized across several manufacturers product lines Product Performance We define product performance as how well a product implements its intended functions Typical product performance characteristics are speed efficiency life accuracy and noise An integral architecture facilitates the optimization of holistic performance characteristics and those that are driven by the size shape and mass of a product Such characteristics include acceleration energy consumption aerodynamic drag noise and aesthetics Consider for example a motorcycle A conventional motorcycle architecture assigns the structural support functional element to a frame chunk and the power conversion functional element to a transmission chunk Exhibit 10 5 shows a photograph of the BMW The architecture of this motorcycle assigns both the structural support function and the power conversion function to the transmission chunk This integral architecture allows the motorcycle designers to exploit the secondary structural properties of the transmission casing in order to eliminate the extra size and mass of a Chapter 10 EXHIBIT 1 0 5 The BMW motorcycle This product exhibits function sharing and an integral architecture with the design of its transmission chunk Courtesy of BMW Motorcycle Group frame The practice of implementing multiple using a single physical element is called function sharing An integral architecture allows for redundancy to be eliminated through function sharing as in the case of the motorcycle and allows for geometric nesting of components to minimize the volume a product occupies Such function sharing and nesting also allow material use to be minimized potentially reducing the cost of manufacturing the product In addition to the cost implications of product variety and component standardization described above the product architecture also directly affects the ability of the team to design each chunk to be produced at low cost One important design for manufacturing strategy involves the minimization of the number of parts in a product through component integration However to maintain a given architecture the integration Architecture 1 91 physical components can only be easily considered within each of the chunks Component integration across several chunks is difficult if not impossible and would alter the architecture dramatically Because the product architecture constrains subsequent detail design decisions in this way the team must consider the manufacturing implications of the architecture For this reason begins during the system level design phase while the layout of the chunks is being planned For details about the implementation of see Chapter 13 Design for Manufacturing Product Development Management Responsibility for the detail design of each chunk is usually assigned to a relatively small group within the firm or to an outside supplier Chunks are assigned to a single individual or group because their design requires careful resolution of interactions geometric and otherwise among components within the chunk With a modular architecture the group assigned to design a chunk deals with known and relatively limited functional interactions with other chunks If a functional element is implemented by two or more chunks as in some integral architectures detail design will require close coordination among different groups This coordination is likely to be substantially more involved and challenging than the limited coordination required among groups designing different chunks in a modular design For this reason teams relying on outside suppliers or on a geographically dispersed team often opt for a modular architecture in which development responsibilities can be split according to the chunk boundaries Another possibility is to have several functional elements allocated to the same chunk In this case the work of the group assigned to that chunk involves a great deal of internal coordination across a larger group Modular and integral architectures also demand different project management styles Modular approaches require very careful planning during the system level design phase but detail design is largely concerned with ensuring that the teams assigned to chunks are meeting the performance cost and schedule requirements for their chunks An integral architecture may require less planning and specification during system level design but such an architecture requires substantially more integration conflict resolution and coordination during the detail design phase Establishing the Architecture Because the product architecture will have profound implications for subsequent product development activities and for the manufacturing and marketing of the completed product it should be established in a cross functional effort by the development team The end result of this activity is an approximate geometric layout of the product descriptions of the major chunks and documentation of the key interactions among the chunks We recommend a four step method to structure the decision process which is illustrated using the printer example The steps are 1 Create a schematic of the product 2 Cluster the elements of the schematic 3 Create a rough geometric layout 4 Identify the fundamental and incidental interactions 192 Chapter 10 Enclose Printer Print Provide

1 0 6 Schematic of the printer Note the presence of both functional elements e g Store Output and physical elements e g Print Cartridge For clarity not all connections among elements are shown Step 1 Create a Schematic of the Product A schematic is a diagram representing the team s understanding of the constituent elements of the product A schematic for the is shown in Exhibit 10 6 At the end of the concept development phase some of the elements in the schematic are physical concepts such as the front in front out paper path Some of the elements correspond to critical components such as the print cartridge the team expects to use However some of the elements remain described only functionally These are the functional elements of the product that have not yet been reduced to physical concepts or components For example display status is a functional element required for the printer but the particular approach of the display has not yet been decided Those elements that have been reduced to physical concepts or components are usually central to the basic product concept the team has generated and selected Those elements that remain unspecified in physical terms are usually ancillary functions of the product The schematic should reflect the team s best understanding of the state of the product but it does not have to contain every imaginable detail such as sense out of Architecture 1 93 condition or shield radio frequency emissions These and other more detailed functional elements are deferred to a later step A good rule of thumb is to aim for fewer than 30 elements in the schematic for the purpose of establishing the product architecture If the product is a complex system involving hundreds of functional elements then it is useful to omit some of the minor ones and to group some others into higher level functions to be decomposed later See Defining Secondary Systems later in this chapter The schematic created will not be unique The specific choices made in creating the schematic such as the choice of functional elements and their arrangement partly define the product architecture For example the functional element control printer is represented as a single centralized element in Exhibit 10 6 An alternative would be to distribute the control of each of the other elements of the product throughout the system and have coordination done by the host computer Because there is usually substantial latitude in the schematic the team should generate several alternatives and select an approach that will facilitate the consideration of several architectural options Step 2 Cluster the Elements of the Schematic The challenge of step 2 is to assign each of the elements of the schematic to a chunk One possible assignment of elements to chunks is shown in Exhibit 10 7 where nine chunks are used Although this was the approximate approach taken by the team there are several other viable alternatives At one extreme each element could be assigned to its own chunk yielding 15 chunks At the other extreme the team could decide that the product would have only one major chunk and then attempt to physically integrate all of the elements of the product In fact consideration of all possible clusterings of elements would yield thousands of alternatives One procedure for managing the complexity of the alternatives is to begin with the assumption that each element of the schematic will be assigned to its own chunk and then to successively cluster elements where advantageous To determine when there are advantages to clustering consider these factors which echo the implications discussed in the previous section Geometric integration and precision Assigning elements to the same chunk allows a single individual or group to control the physical relationships among the elements Elements requiring precise location or close geometric integration can often be best designed if they are part of the same chunk For the printer this would suggest clustering the elements associated with positioning the cartridge in the x axis and positioning the paper in the y axis Function sharing When a single physical component can implement several functional elements of the product these functional elements are best clustered together This is the situation exemplified by the BMW motorcycle transmission Exhibit 10 5 For the printer the team believed that the status display and the user controls could be incorporated into the same component and so clustered these two elements together Capabilities of vendors A trusted vendor may have specific capabilities related to a project and in order to best take advantage of such capabilities a team may choose to cluster those elements about which the vendor has expertise into one chunk In the case of the printer an internal team did the majority of the engineering design work and so this was not a major consideration 194 Chapter 10 Enclosure Enclose Printer Provide Structural Support Position Cartridge Chassis in X Axis Print Cartridge User Interface Board Position Paper i in Y Axis I Power Cord I and Brick Pick Paper Print Mechanism Communicate Command Printer Host Host Driver Software Connect to Host Logic Board EXHIBIT 1 0 7 Clustering the elements into chunks Nine chunks make up this proposed architecture for the De printer Similarity of design or production technology When two or more functional elements are likely to be implemented using the same design and or production technology then incorporating these elements into the same chunk may allow for more economical design and or production A common strategy for example is to combine all functions that are likely to involve electronics in the same chunk This allows the possibility of implementing all of these functions with a single circuit board 0 Localization of change When a team anticipates a great deal of change in some element it makes sense to isolate that element into its own modular chunk so that required changes to the element can be carried out without disrupting any of the other chunks The Hewlett Packard team anticipated changing the physical appearance of the product over its life cycle and so chose to isolate the enclosure element into its own chunk Accommodating variety Elements should be clustered together to enable the firm to vary the product in ways that will have value for customers The printer was to be 10 8 Geometric layout of the printer Product Architecture 1 95 fl User Interface Board Enclosure I Print Cartridge Roller Guide Pa p Paper Tray Logic Board Chassis around the world in regions with different electrical power standards As a result the team created a separate chunk for the element associated with supplying DC power Enabling standardization If a set of elements will be useful in other products they should be clustered together into a single chunk This allows the physical elements of the chunk to be produced in higher quantities Hewlett Packard s internal standardization was a key motive for using an existing print cartridge and so this element is preserved as its own chunk Portability of the interfaces Some interactions are easily transmitted over large distances For example electrical signals are much more portable than are mechanical forces and motions As a result elements with electronic interactions can be easily separated from one another This is also true but to a lesser extent for fluid connections The flexibility of electrical interactions allowed the Hewlett Packard team to cluster the control and communication functions into the same chunk Conversely the elements related to paper handling are much more geometrically constrained by their necessary mechanical interactions Step 3 Create a Rough Geometric Layout A geometric layout can be created in two or three dimensions using drawings computer models or physical models of cardboard or foam for example Exhibit 10 8 shows a geometric layout of the printer positioning the major chunks Creating a geometric layout forces the team to consider whether the geometric interfaces among the chunks are feasible and to work out the basic dimensional relationships among Chapter 10 EXHIBIT 1 0 9 Incidental interaction graph chunks By considering a cross section of the printer the team realized that there was a fundamental trade off between how much paper could be stored in the paper tray and the height of the machine In this step as in the previous step the team benefits from generating several alternative layouts and selecting the best one Layout decision criteria are closely related to the clustering issues in step 2 In some cases the team may discover that the clustering derived in step 2 is not geometrically feasible and thus some of the elements would have to be reassigned to other chunks Creating the rough layout should be coordinated with the industrial designers on the team in cases where the aesthetic and human interface issues of the product are important and strongly related to the geometric arrangement of the chunks Step 4 Identify the Fundamental and Incidental Interactions Most likely a different person or group will be assigned to design each chunk Because the chunks interact with one another in both planned and unintended ways these different groups will have to coordinate their activities and exchange information In order to better manage this coordination process the team should identify the known interactions between chunks during the system level design phase There are two categories of interactions between chunks First fundamental interactions are those corresponding to the lines on the schematic that connect the chunks to one another For example a sheet of paper flows from the paper tray to the print mechanism This interaction is planned and it should be well understood even from the very earliest schematic as it is fundamental to the system s operation Second incidental interactions are those that arise because of the particular physical implementation of functional elements or because of the geometric arrangement of the chunks For example vibrations induced by the actuators in the paper tray could interfere with the precise location of the print cartridge in the x axis While the fundamental interactions are explicitly represented by the schematic showing the clustering of elements into chunks the incidental interactions must be documented in some other way For a small number of interacting chunks fewer than about 10 an interaction graph is a convenient way to represent the incidental interactions Exhibit 10 9 shows a possible interaction graph for the printer representing the known incidental interactions For larger systems this type of graph becomes confusing Enclosure Board Styling V b t Thermal Host Pa p y Mechanism Board Software Thermal Distortion RF Interference RF Shielding Power Cord Chassis and Brick Product Architecture 1 97 and an interaction matrix is useful instead and can be used to display both fundamental and incidental interactions See 1997 for an example of using such a matrix which is also used to cluster the functional elements into chunks based on quantification of their interactions The interaction graph in Exhibit 10 9 suggests that vibration and thermal distortion are incidental interactions among the chunks that create heat and involve positioning motions These interactions represent challenges in the development of the system requiring focused coordination efforts within the team We can use the mapping of the interactions between the chunks to provide guidance for structuring and managing the remaining development activities Chunks with important interactions should be designed by groups with strong communication and coordination between them Conversely chunks with little interaction can be designed by groups with less coordination 1997 describes a matrix based method for prescribing such system level coordination needs in larger projects It is also possible through careful advance coordination to develop two interacting chunks in a completely independent fashion This is facilitated when the interactions between the two chunks can be reduced in advance to a completely specified interface that will be implemented by both chunks It is relatively straightforward to specify interfaces to handle the fundamental interactions while it can be difficult to do so for incidental interactions Knowledge of the incidental interactions and sometimes of the fundamental interactions as well develops as system level and detail design progress The schematic and the interaction graph or matrix can be used for documenting this information as it evolves The network of interactions among subsystems modules and components is sometimes called the system architecture Delayed Differentiation When a firm offers several variants of a product the product architecture is a key determinant of the performance of the supply chain the sequence of production and distribution activities that links raw materials and components to finished products in the hands of customers Imagine three different versions of the printer each adapted to a different electrical power standard in three different geographic regions Consider at what point along the supply chain the product is uniquely defined as one of these three variants Assume that the supply chain consists of three basic activities assembly transportation and packaging Exhibit 10 10 illustrates how the number of distinct variants of the product evolves as the product moves through the supply chain In scenario A the three versions of the printer are defined during assembly then transported and finally packaged In scenario B the assembly activity is divided into two stages most of the product is assembled in the first stage the product is then transported assembly is completed and finally the product is packaged In scenario B the components associated with power conversion are assembled after transportation and so the product is not differentiated until near the end of the supply chain Postponing the differentiation of a product until late in the supply chain is called delayed differentiation or simply postponement and may offer substantial Chapter 10 Scenario A Early Differentiation i fl iv g Assembly Q A Differentiation Transport Inventory of Three Models w Scenario B Postponement Transport Inventory of One Subassembly Partial Assembly Delayed Differentiation EXHIBIT 1 0 1 0 Postponement involves delaying differentiation of the product until late in the supply chain In scenario A three versions of the product are created during assembly and before transportation In scenario B the three versions of the product are not created until after transportation Product Architecture 1 99 in the costs of operating the supply chain primarily through reductions in inventory requirements For most products and especially for innovative products demand for each version of a product is unpredictable That is there is a component of demand that varies randomly from one time period to the next To offer consistently high product availability in the presence of such demand uncertainty requires that inventory be held somewhere near the end of the supply chain To understand why this is so imagine a McDonald s restaurant trying to respond to minute to minute fluctuations in demand for fries if it peeled cut and fried potatoes only after an order was placed Instead it maintains an inventory of cooked fries that can be quickly scooped into a package and delivered For printers transportation by ship between production and distribution sites may require several weeks So to be responsive to fluctuations in demand substantial inventories must be held after transportation The amount of inventory required for a given target level of availability is a function of the magnitude of the variability in demand Postponement enables substantial reductions in the cost of inventories because there is substantially less randomness in the demand for the basic elements of the product e g the platform than there is for the differentiating components of the variants of the product This is because in most cases demand for different versions of a product is somewhat uncorrelated so that when demand for one version is high it is possible that demand for some other version of the product will be low Two design principles are necessary conditions for postponement 1 The differentiating elements of the product must be concentrated in one or a few chunks In order to differentiate the product through one or a few simple process steps the differentiating attributes of the product must be defined by one or a few components of the product Consider the case of the different electrical power requirements for printers in different geographical regions If the differences between a product adapted for power in the United States and power in Europe were associated with several components distributed throughout the product e g power cord power switch transformer rectifier etc all in different chunks there would be no way to delay differentiation of the product without also delaying the assembly of these several chunks See Exhibit 10 11 top If however the only difference between these two models is a single chunk containing a cord and a power supply brick then the difference between the two IE EXHIBIT 1 0 1 1 To enable postponement the differentiating attributes of the product must be concentrated in one or a few chunks In the top case the power supply is distributed across the cord enclosure chassis and logic board In the bottom case the power supply is confined to the cord and a power supply brick 200 Chapter 10 versions of the product requires differences in only one chunk and one assembly operation See Exhibit 10 11 bottom 2 The product and production process must be designed so that the differentiating chunk s can be added to the product near the end of the supply chain Even if the differentiating attributes of the product correspond to a single chunk postponement may not be possible This is because the constraints of the assembly process or product design may require that this chunk be assembled early in the supply chain For example one could envision the consumer packaging of the printer i e the printed carton being a primary differentiating chunk because of different language requirements for different markets If transporting the product from the factory to the distribution center required that the printer be assembled into its carton then it would be impossible to postpone the differentiation of the product with respect to packaging type To avoid this problem Hewlett Packard devised a clever packaging scheme in which molded trays are used to position several dozen bare assembled printers on each of several layers of a large shipping pallet which can then be wrapped with plastic film and loaded directly into a shipping container This approach allows differentiation of the carton to occur after the printers have been transported to the distribution center and the appropriate power supply installed Platform Planning Hewlett Packard provides products to customers with different needs For illustrative purposes think of these customers as belonging to three market segments family student and small ice home SOHO To serve these customers Hewlett Packard could develop three entirely different products it could offer only one product to all three segments or it could differentiate these products through differences in only a subset of the printer components See Chapter 4 Product Planning for discussion of related decisions A desirable property of the product architecture is that it enables a company to offer two or more products that are highly differentiated yet share a substantial fraction of their components The collection of assets including component designs shared by these products is called a product platform Planning the product platform involves managing a basic trade off between distinctiveness and commonality On the one hand there are market benefits to offering several very distinctive versions of a product On the other hand there are design and manufacturing benefits to maximizing the extent to which these different products share common components Two simple information systems allow the team to manage this trade off the differentiation plan and the commonality plan Differentiation Plan The differentiation plan explicitly represents the ways in which multiple versions of a product will be different from the perspective of the customer and the market Exhibit 10 12 shows an example differentiation plan The plan consists of a matrix with rows for the differentiating attributes of the printer and with columns for the different versions or models of the product By differentiating attributes we mean those characteristics of the product that are important to the customer and that are intended to be different across the products Differentiating attributes are generally expressed in the language Architecture 201 Differentiating Attributes Family Student SOHO Small Office Home Office Black print

EXHIBIT 1 0 1 3 An example commonality plan for a family of three printers specifications as described in Chapter 6 Product Specifications The team uses the differentiation plan to codify its decisions about how the products will be different Unconstrained the differentiation plan would exactly match the preferences of the customers in the market segments targeted by each different product Unfortunately such plans generally imply products that are prohibitively costly Commonality Plan The commonality plan explicitly represents the ways in which the different versions of the product are the same physically Exhibit 10 13 shows a commonality plan for the printer example The plan consists of a matrix with rows representing the chunks of the product The third fourth and fifth columns correspond to the three different versions of the product The second column indicates the number of different types of each chunk that are implied by the plan The team fills each cell in the remaining columns with a label for each different version of a chunk that will be used to make up the product Unconstrained most manufacturing engineers would probably choose to use only one version of each chunk in all variants of the product Unfortunately this strategy would result in products that are undifferentiated 202 Chapter 10 Managing the Trade Off between Differentiation and Commonality The challenge in platform planning is to resolve the tension between the desire to differentiate the products and the desire for these products to share a substantial fraction of their components Examination of the differentiation plan and the commonality plan reveals several trade offs For example the student printer has the potential to offer the benefit of a small footprint which is likely to be important to space conscious college students However this differentiating attribute implies that the student printer would require a different print mechanism chunk which is likely to add substantially to the investment required to design and produce the printer This tension between a desire to tailor the benefits of a product to the target market segment and the desire to minimize investment is highlighted when the team attempts to make the differentiation plan and the commonality plan consistent We offer several guidelines for managing this tension Platform planning decisions should be informed by quantitative estimates of cost and revenue implications Estimating the profit contribution from a one increase in market share is a useful benchmark against which to measure the potential increase in manufacturing and supply chain costs of additional versions of a chunk In estimating supply chain costs the team must consider the extent to which the differentiation implied by the differentiation plan can be postponed or whether it must be created early in the supply chain Iteration is beneficial In our experience teams make better decisions when they make several iterations based on approximate information than when they agonize over the details during relatively fewer iterations The product architecture dictates the nature of the trade off between differentiation and commonality The nature of the trade off between differentiation and commonality is not fixed Generally modular architectures enable a higher proportion of components to be shared than integral architectures This implies that when confronted with a seemingly intractable conflict between differentiation and commonality the team should consider alternative architectural approaches which may provide opportunities to enhance both differentiation and commonality For the printer example the tension between differentiation and commonality might be resolved by a compromise The revenue benefits of a slightly narrower student printer are not likely to exceed the costs associated with creating an entirely different and narrower print mechanism The costs of different print mechanisms are likely to be especially high given that the print mechanism involves substantial tooling investments Also because the print mechanism is created early in the supply chain postponement of differentiation would be substantially less feasible if it required different print mechanisms For these reasons the team would most likely choose to use a single common print mechanism and forgo the possible revenue benefits of a narrower footprint for the student printer Related System Level Design Issues The four step method for establishing the product architecture guides the early design activities but many more detailed activities remain Here we discuss some 1 0 1 4 Specification of interface between black print cartridge and logic board Product Architecture 203 the issues that frequently arise during subsequent system level design activities and their implications for the product architecture Defining Secondary Systems The schematic in Exhibit 10 6 shows only the key elements of the product There are many other functional and physical elements not shown some of which will only be conceived and detailed as the system level design evolves These additional elements make up the secondary systems of the product Examples include safety systems power systems status monitors and structural supports Some of these systems such as safety systems will span several chunks Fortunately secondary systems usually involve flexible connections such as wiring and tubing and can be considered after the major architectural decisions have been made Secondary systems cutting across the boundaries of chunks present a special management challenge Should a single group or individual be assigned to design a secondary system even though the system will be made up of components residing in several different chunks Or should the group or individuals responsible for the chunks be responsible for coordinating among themselves to ensure that the secondary systems will work as needed The former approach is more typical where specific individuals or are assigned to focus on the secondary systems Establishing the Architecture of the Chunks Some of the chunks of a complex product may be very complex systems in their own right For example many of the chunks in the printer involve dozens of parts Each of these chunks may have its own architecture the scheme by which it is divided into smaller chunks This problem is essentially identical to the architectural challenge posed at the level of the entire product Careful consideration of the architecture of the chunks is nearly as important as the creation of the architecture of the overall product For example the print cartridge consists of the store ink and deliver ink for each of four colors of ink Several architectural approaches are possible for this chunk including for example the use of independently replaceable reservoirs for each ink color Line Name Properties A B Black Logic STAT Print Board Cartridge l 11 U I O 204 Chapter 10 Creating Detailed Interface Specifications As the system level design progresses the fundamental interactions indicated by lines on the schematic in Exhibit 10 6 are specified as much more detailed collections of signals material flows and exchanges of energy As this refinement occurs the specification of the interfaces between chunks should also be clarified For example Exhibit 10 14 shows an overview of a possible specification of an interface between a black print cartridge and a logic board for a printer Such interfaces represent the contracts between chunks and are often detailed in formal specification documents Summary Product architecture is the scheme by which the functional elements of the product are arranged into physical chunks The architecture of the product is established during the concept development and system level design phases of development Product architecture decisions have far reaching implications affecting such things as product change product variety component standardization product performance and product development management 0 A key characteristic of a product architecture is the degree to which it is modular or integral Modular architectures are those in which each physical chunk implements a specific set of functional elements and has well defined interactions with the other chunks 0 There are three types of modular architectures slot modular bus modular and sectional modular Integral architectures are those in which the implementation of functional elements is spread across chunks resulting in ill defined interactions between the chunks We recommend a four step method for establishing the product architecture 1 Create a schematic of the product 2 Cluster the elements of the schematic 3 Create a rough geometric layout 4 Identify the fundamental and incidental interactions 0 This method leads the team through the preliminary architectural decisions Subsequent system level and detail design activities will contribute to a continuing evolution of the architectural details The product architecture can enable postponement the delayed differentiation of the product which offers substantial potential cost savings Architectural choices are closely linked to platform planning the balancing of differentiation and commonality when addressing different market segments with different versions of a product Due to the broad implications of architectural decisions inputs from marketing manufacturing and design are essential in this aspect of product development Product

likely fundamental and incidental interactions that any one functional element say safety restraints would have with the others How would you use the documentation of such interactions to guide the decision about what chunk to place this functional element in 5 The schematic shown in Exhibit 10 6 includes 15 elements Consider the possibility of assigning each element to its own chunk What are the strengths and weaknesses of such an architecture CHAPTER ELEVEN EXHIBIT 1 1 1 Evolution of Motorola flip phones Shown clockwise from top left are the 1989 l 993 2001 and 2004 models Courtesy of Motorola Inc Industrial Chapter 1 1 In 2003 Motorola launched a product development effort to augment its very successful but aging lines of flip style or clamshell mobile telephones with an exciting new product The and V series platforms had each seen several generations of products released since the early eventually including models for every major worldwide market and standard The design emerged from a product vision to be thin to win considerably thinner than other mobile telephones on the market and striking in its iconic new form This design required a new architecture entirely distinct from the existing product platforms Upon its introduction in 2004 customers judged the ultra thin design shown in Exhibit 11 1 to be just as radical as its Motorola flip phone predecessors when they were released Sales to early adopters came quickly after a successful market introduction in which Hollywood celebrities were shown with the product Surpassing Motorola s expectations sales reached millions of units within one year of launch This success can be attributed to several factors Small size and weight With its slimmer form factor the was more than other mobile phone models The had a thickness of 14 millimeters and a weight of 95 grams making it the thinnest and one of the lightest mobile phones on the market at the time Performance features The featured an integrated VGA camera a large keypad and a large bright color display for new video and graphic applications Instead of a headset jack the utilized networking for wireless headset accessories Superior signal reception and transmission were achieved with a novel layout in which the phone s antenna was positioned below the keypad and away from the user s fingers which can block weak signals Superior ergonomics The s sleek ergonomic design complemented the human face The shape of the handset particularly the angled position of the display with respect to the keypad section conformed to the user for superior comfort The spacing and position of the buttons on the keypad were based on accepted standards and extensive testing allowed for fast and accurate dialing The folding design allowed the user to answer or end calls by opening or closing the phone with one hand aided by a recess between the two sections of the clamshell New software for navigation and new shortcuts for entering text facilitated use of text messaging and other applications 0 Durability As with all Motorola products the was designed to meet rigorous specifications It could be dropped from a height of more than 1 meter onto a cement floor or sat upon in the open position without sustaining any damage The could also withstand temperature extremes humidity shock dust and vibration Materials The utilized several advanced materials to enhance both performance and appearance These included a laser cut keypad with laser etched patterns magnesium hinge ultra thin anodized aluminum housing polycarbonate composite antenna housing and chemically annealed glass with a thin film coating Appearance The sleek design and metallic finishes gave the a futuristic look associated with innovation Because of its aesthetic appeal and highly recognizable appearance the quickly became somewhat of a status symbol for early adopters and created strong feelings of pride among owners Industrial Design 209 The development team included electrical mechanical materials software and manufacturing engineers whose contributions were instrumental in developing the technologies and manufacturing processes that allowed the product to achieve its form factor performance and weight However without the contributions of industrial designers who defined the size shape and human factors the would never have taken its innovative ultra thin form In fact the Motorola team could easily have developed just another phone smaller and lighter than the previous flip phone models Instead a revolutionary concept generated by the industrial designers on the team turned the project into a dramatic success Industrial designers are primarily responsible for the aspects of a product that relate to the user s experience the product s aesthetic appeal how it looks sounds feels smells and its functional interfaces how it is used For many manufacturers industrial design has historically been an afterthought Managers used industrial designers to style or gift wrap a product after its technical features were determined Companies would then market the product on the merits of its technology alone even though customers certainly evaluate a product using more holistic judgments including ergonomics and style Today a product s core technology is generally not enough to ensure commercial success The of markets has resulted in the design and manufacture of a wide array of consumer products Fierce competition makes it unlikely that a company will enjoy a sustainable competitive advantage through technology alone Accordingly companies such as Motorola are increasingly using industrial design as an important tool for both satisfying customer needs and differentiating their products from those of their competition This chapter introduces engineers and managers to industrial design ID and explains how the ID process takes place in relation to other product development activities We refer to the example throughout this chapter to explain critical ideas Specifically this chapter presents 0 A historical perspective on ID and a working definition of ID 0 Statistics on typical investments in ID 0 A method for determining the importance of ID to a particular product The costs and benefits of investing in ID 0 How ID helps to establish a corporation s identity Specific steps industrial designers follow while designing a product 0 A description of how the ID process changes according to product type 0 A method for assessing the quality of the ID effort for a completed product What Is Industrial Design The birth of ID is often traced to western Europe in the early See Lorenz 1986 for an account of the history of ID which is summarized here Several German companies including a large electrical manufacturer commissioned a multitude of craftspeople and architects to design various products for manufacture Initially these early European designers had little direct impact on industry however their work resulted in lasting theories that influenced and shaped what is today known as industrial design 210 Chapter 11 Early European approaches to ID such as the Bauhaus movement went beyond mere functionalism they emphasized the importance of geometry precision simplicity and economy in the design of products In short early European designers believed that a product should be designed from the inside out Form should follow function In the United States however early concepts of ID were distinctly different While early European industrial designers were architects and engineers most industrial designers in America were actually theater designers and artist illustrators Not surprisingly ID in the United States was often at the service of sales and advertising where a product s exterior was all important and its insides mattered little Pioneers in US industrial design including Walter Norman Bel and Raymond emphasized streamlining in product design This trend is best evidenced in US products of the From fountain pens to baby buggies products were designed with nonfunctional aerodynamic shapes in an attempt to create product appeal The auto industry provides another example The shapes of European automobiles of the were fairly simple and smooth while US cars of the same era were decorated with such nonfunctional features as and chrome teeth By the however European design had strongly influenced American ID largely through the works of Henry Dreyfuss and Eliot Noyes Heightened competition in the marketplace forced companies to search for ways to improve and differentiate their products Increasingly companies accepted the notion that the role of ID needed to go beyond mere shape and appearance Success stories such as Bell Deere Ford and IBM all of which effectively integrated ID into their product development process helped further this thinking By 2000 industrial design became widely practiced in the United States by professionals in many diverse settings ranging from small design consulting firms to in house design offices within large manufacturing companies Motorola s industrial designers comprise a department titled consumer experience design and participate fully in all new product development efforts The Industrial Designers Society of America defines industrial design as the professional service of creating and developing concepts and specifications that optimize the function value and appearance of products and systems for the mutual benefit of both user and manufacturer This definition is broad enough to include the activities of the entire product development team In fact industrial designers focus their attention upon the form and user interaction of products Dreyfuss 1967 lists five critical goals that industrial designers can help a team to achieve when developing new products Utility The product s human interfaces should be safe easy to use and intuitive Each feature should be shaped so that it communicates its function to the user 0 Appearance Form line proportion and color are used to integrate the product into a pleasing whole Ease of maintenance Products must also be designed to communicate how they are to be maintained and repaired Low costs Form and features have a large impact on tooling and production costs so these must be considered jointly by the team Communication Product designs should communicate the corporate design philosophy and mission through the visual qualities of the products Industrial Design 21 1 Industrial designers are typically educated in four year university programs where they study sculpture and form develop drawing presentation and model making skills and gain a basic understanding of materials manufacturing techniques and finishes In industrial practice designers receive additional exposure to basic engineering advanced manufacturing fabrication processes and common marketing practices Their ability to express ideas visually can facilitate the process of concept development for the team Industrial designers may create most of the concept sketches models and renderings used by the team throughout the development process even though the ideas come from the entire team Assessing the Need for Industrial Design To assess the importance of ID to a particular product we first review some investment statistics and then define the dimensions of a product that are dependent upon good ID Expenditures for Industrial Design Exhibit 11 2 shows approximate values of investment in ID for a variety of products Both the total expenditures on ID and the percentage of the product development budget invested in ID are shown for consumer and industrial products spanning various industries These statistics should give design teams a rough idea of how much ID investment will be required for a new product The exhibit shows that the range of expenditures on ID is tremendous For products with relatively little user interaction such as some types of industrial equipment the cost of ID is only in the tens of thousands of dollars On the other hand the development of an intensely visual and interactive product such as an automobile requires millions of dollars of ID effort The relative cost of ID as a fraction of the overall development budget also shows a wide range For a technically sophisticated product such as a new aircraft the ID cost can be insignificant relative to the engineering and other development expenditures This does not suggest however that ID is unimportant for such products it suggests only that the other development functions are more costly Certainly the success of a new automobile design is highly dependent on its aesthetic appeal and the quality of the user interfaces two dimensions largely determined by ID yet the ID expense of 10 million is modest relative to the entire development budget How Important ls Industrial Design to a Product Most products on the market can be improved in some way or another by good ID All products that are used operated or seen by people depend critically on ID for commercial success With this in mind a convenient means for assessing the importance of ID to a particular product is to characterize importance along two dimensions ergonomics and aesthetics Note that we use the term ergonomics to encompass all aspects of a product that relate to its human interfaces The more important each dimension is to the product s success the more dependent the product is on ID Therefore by answering a series of questions along each dimension we can qualitatively assess the importance of ID 212 Chapter 11 30 Percentage of Product Development Budget Spent on Industrial Design 20 10 0 EXHIBIT 1 1 2 0 Medical Instrument Vacuum 0 Desktop Computer Peripheral Large Scale Medical Phone Power Tool Imaging Equipment 0 Industrial Food 0 Automobile Jumbo Jet Processing Equipment 0 O 10 100 1 000 10 000 100 000 Total Expenditures on Industrial Design Thousands Industrial design expenditures for some consumer and industrial products Ergonomic Needs How important is ease of use Ease of use may be extremely important both for frequently used products such as an office photocopier and for infrequently used products such as a fire extinguisher Ease of use is more challenging if the product has multiple features and or modes of operation that may confuse or frustrate the user When ease of use is an important criterion industrial designers will need to ensure that the features of the product effectively communicate their function How important is ease of maintenance If the product needs to be serviced or repaired frequently then ease of maintenance is crucial For example a user should be able to clear a paper jam in a printer or photocopier easily Again it is critical that the features of the product communicate maintenance repair procedures to the user However in many cases a more desirable solution is to eliminate the need for maintenance entirely How many user interactions are required for the product s functions In general the more interactions users have with the product the more the product will depend on ID For example a doorknob typically requires only one interaction whereas a laptop computer may require a dozen or more all of which the industrial designer must understand in depth Furthermore each interaction may require a different design approach and or additional research Industrial Design 21 3 How novel are the user interaction needs A user interface requiring incremental improvements to an existing design will be relatively straightforward to design such as the buttons on a new desktop computer mouse A more novel user interface may require substantial research and feasibility studies such as the click wheel on the early Apple music player What are the safety issues All products have safety considerations For some products these can present significant challenges to the design team For example the safety concerns in the design of a child s toy are much more prominent than those for a new computer mouse Aesthetic Needs Is visual product differentiation required Products with stable markets and technology are highly dependent upon ID to create aesthetic appeal and hence visual differentiation In contrast a product such as a computer s internal disk drive which is differentiated by its technological performance is less dependent on ID How important are pride of ownership image and fashion A customer s perception of a product is in part based upon its aesthetic appeal An attractive product may be associated with high fashion and image and will likely create a strong sense of pride among its owners This may similarly be true for a product that looks and feels rugged or conservative When such characteristics are important ID will play a critical role in determining the product s ultimate success Will an aesthetic product motivate the team A product that is aesthetically appealing can generate a sense of team pride among the design and manufacturing staff Team pride helps motivate and unify everyone associated with the project An early ID concept gives the team a concrete vision of the end result of the development effort To demonstrate this method we can use the above questions to assess the importance of industrial design in the development of the Motorola phone Exhibit 11 3 displays the results of such analysis We find that both ergonomics and aesthetics were extremely important for the Accordingly ID did indeed play a large role in determining many of the product s critical success factors The Impact of Industrial Design The previous section focused primarily upon the importance of ID in satisfying customer needs Next we explore both the direct economic impact of investing in ID as well as its impact on corporate identity ls Industrial Design Worth the Investment Managers will want to know for a specific product or for a business operation in general how much effort should be invested in industrial design While it is difficult to answer this question precisely we can offer several insights by considering the costs and benefits The costs of ID include direct cost manufacturing cost and time cost described next 214 Chapter 11 Needs Level of Importance Explanation of Rating Low Medium High Ergonomics Ease of use l Q l Critical for a mobile telephone because it may be used frequently may be needed in emergency situations and can be operated by motorists while driving The product s function must be communicated through its design Ease of maintenance 0 As with many integrated electronics products there is very little maintenance required C There are many important user interactions such as entering text dialing and storing numbers sending and receiving calls taking photos Internet access Quantity of user interactions Novelty of user interactions l O l Design solutions associated with some of the customer interactions were straightforward such as the numeric keypad because there is a wealth of human factors data that dictate the basic dimensions However other interfaces such as the one handed operation of such a thin phone were quite different from earlier models and therefore required careful study Safety l O l There were few safety issues for ID to consider on the itself However because many customers use mobile telephones in automobiles a line of wireless accessories needed to be designed for safe convenient hands free operation Aesthetics I O

s novel form turned out to be an important inspiration to the development team and a selling point for senior management EXHIBIT 1 1 3 Assessing the importance of industrial design for Motorola s mobile phone Industrial Design 21 5 Direct cost is the cost of the ID services This quantity is determined by the number and type of designers used duration of the project and number of models required plus material costs and other related expenses In 2011 ID consulting services in the United States cost 75 to 300 per hour with most of the work being done by designers in the lower half of this price range and senior designers contributing relatively few hours of more strategic work in the higher half of the range Additional charges include costs for models photos and other expenses The true cost of internal corporate design services is generally about the same Manufacturing cost is the expense incurred to implement the product details created through ID Surface finishes stylized shapes rich colors and many other design details can increase tooling cost and or production cost Note however that many ID details can be implemented at practically no cost particularly if ID is involved early enough in the process see below In fact some ID inputs can actually reduce manufacturing costs particularly when the industrial designer works closely with the manufacturing engineers Time cost is the penalty associated with extended lead time As industrial designers attempt to refine the ergonomics and aesthetics of a product multiple design iterations and or prototypes will be necessary This may result in a delay in the product s introduction which will likely have an economic cost The benefits of using ID include increased product appeal and greater customer satisfaction through additional or better features strong brand identity and product differentiation These benefits usually translate into a price premium and or increased market share as compared to marketing the product without the ID efforts These costs and benefits of ID were estimated as part of a study conducted at MIT that assessed the impact of detail design decisions on product success factors for a set of competing products in the market automatic drip coffeemakers Although the relation is difficult to quantify precisely this study found a significant correlation between product aesthetics as rated by practicing industrial designers and the retail price for each product but no correlation between aesthetics and manufacturing cost The researchers could not conclude whether the manufacturers had priced their products optimally and could not determine unequivocally if aesthetics of the products enabled manufacturers to garner higher prices However the study suggests that an increase in price of 1 per unit for typical sales volumes would be worth several million dollars in profits over the life of these products Industrial designers asked to price design services for such products gave a range from 75 000 to 250 000 suggesting that if ID could add even one dollar s worth of perceived benefit to the consumer it would pay back handsomely Pearson 1992 A second study conducted at the Open University in England also suggests that investing in ID yields a positive return This study tracked the commercial impact of investing in engineering and ID for 221 design projects at small and medium sized manufacturing firms The study found that investing in industrial design consultants led to profits in over 90 percent of all implemented projects and when comparisons were possible with previous less ID oriented products sales increased by an average of 41 percent Roy and Potter 1993 More recent studies have assessed ID effectiveness and the integration of ID into the product development process and found positive correlations between these ID measures and corporate financial performance and 2001 et 2005 216 Chapter 11 For a specific project decision performing simple calculations and sensitivity analyses can help quantify the likely economic returns from ID For example if investing in ID will likely result in a price premium of 10 per unit what will be the net economic benefit when summed over the original market sales projections Similarly if investing in ID will likely result in a greater demand for the product by say 1 000 units per year what will be the net economic benefit when summed at the original unit price The rough estimates of these benefits can be compared to the expected cost of the ID effort Spreadsheet models are commonly used for this kind of financial decision making and can easily be applied to estimate the expected payback of ID for a project Chapter 17 Product Development Economics describes a method for developing such a financial model How Does Industrial Design Establish a Corporate Identity Corporate identity is derived from the visual style of an organization a factor that affects the firm s positioning in the market 1989 A company s identity emerges primarily through what people see Advertising logos uniforms buildings packaging and product designs all contribute to creating corporate identity In product based companies ID plays an important role in determining the company s identity Industrial design determines a product s style which is directly related to the public perception of the firm When a company s products maintain a consistent and recognizable appearance visual equity is established A consistent look and feel may be associated with the product s color form style or even its features When a firm enjoys a positive reputation such visual equity is valuable as it can create a positive association with quality for future products Some companies that have effectively used ID to establish visual equity and corporate identity through their product lines include 0 Apple Inc The original Macintosh had a small upright shape and a benign buff coloring This design purposely gave the product a nonthreatening user friendly look that has since been associated with all of Apple s products More recent Apple designs have striking lines and innovative styling in silver black and white finishes Watch Co The line of watches maintains a classic look and solid feel that signifies quality and prestige 0 Braun Braun kitchen appliances and shavers have clean lines and basic colors The Braun name has long been associated with simplicity and quality Bang en a s B O high fidelity consumer electronics systems are designed to have sleek lines and impressive visual displays providing an image of technological innovation 0 BM WAG BMW automobiles known for luxury features and driver oriented performance display exterior styling features that have evolved slowly retaining the equity associated with the brand 0 Motorola Inc The original and mobile phones were recognized as Motorola s leading edge flip phone innovations The later model also used a folding clamshell concept in a much thinner form factor emphasizing Motorola s leadership in a rapidly evolving industry Industrial Design 21 7 The Industrial Design Process Many large companies have internal industrial design departments Small companies tend to use contract ID services provided by consulting firms In either case industrial designers should participate fully on cross functional product development teams Within these teams engineers will generally follow a process to generate and evaluate concepts for the technical features of a product In a similar manner most industrial designers follow a process for designing the aesthetics and ergonomics of a product Although this approach may vary depending on the firm and the nature of the project industrial designers also generate multiple concepts and then work with engineers to narrow these options down through a series of evaluation steps Specifically the ID process can be thought of as consisting of the following phases Investigation of customer needs Conceptualization Preliminary refinement Further refinement and final concept selection Control drawings or models Coordination with engineering manufacturing and external vendors This section discusses each of these phases in order and the following section will discuss the timing of these phases within the overall product development process 1 Investigation of Customer Needs The product development team begins by documenting customer needs as described in Chapter 5 Identifying Customer Needs Because industrial designers are skilled at recognizing issues involving user interactions ID involvement is crucial in the needs process For example in researching customer needs for a new medical instrument the team would study an operating room interview physicians and conduct focus groups While involvement of marketing engineering and ID certainly leads to a common comprehensive understanding of customer needs for the whole team it particularly allows the industrial designer to gain an intimate understanding of the interactions between the user and the product Unlike many development efforts the project did not rely heavily upon focus groups or formal market research Motorola believed that the high level of secrecy surrounding the project and the difficulty in gaining customer input for next generation products made these techniques impractical Instead the team used extensive input from Motorola employees to understand the evolution of user needs Marketing personnel stressed the importance of Motorola s leadership in form factor and style Engineering supplied information on technical limitations involving materials and geometry of components Motorola s research on consumer perceptions of quality in mobile phones revealed that while light weight was desirable the phone s density was also critical resulting in a target specification for overall density 2 Conceptualization Once the customer needs and constraints are understood the industrial designers help the team conceptualize the product During the concept generation stage engineers Chapter 11 focus their attention upon finding solutions to the technical of the product See Chapter 7 Concept Generation At this time the industrial designers concentrate upon creating the product s form and user interfaces Industrial designers make simple sketches known as thumbnail sketches of each concept These sketches are a fast and inexpensive medium for expressing ideas and evaluating possibilities Exhibit 11 4 shows two such sketches from the project The proposed concepts may then be matched and combined with the technical solutions under exploration Concepts are grouped and evaluated by the team according to the customer needs technical feasibility cost and manufacturing considerations See Chapter 8 Concept Selection It is unfortunate that in some companies industrial designers work quite independently from engineering When this happens ID is likely to propose concepts involving strictly form and style and there are usually numerous iterations when engineering finds the concepts technically infeasible Firms have therefore found it beneficial to tightly coordinate the efforts of industrial designers and engineers throughout the concept development phase so that these iterations can be accomplished more quickly even in sketch form 3 Preliminary Refinement In the preliminary refinement phase industrial designers build models of the most promising concepts Soft models are typically made in full scale using foam or foam core board They are the second fastest method only slightly slower than sketches used to evaluate concepts Although generally quite rough these models are invaluable because they allow the development team to express and visualize product concepts in three dimensions Concepts are evaluated by industrial designers engineers marketing personnel and at times potential customers through the process of touching feeling and modifying the models Typically designers will build as many models as possible depending on time and financial constraints Concepts that are particularly difficult to visualize require more models than do simpler ones The industrial designers used numerous soft models to assess the overall size proportion and shape of many proposed concepts Of particular concern was the feel of the product in the hand and against the face These attributes can only be assessed using physical models A soft model from the project made using rapid prototyping technology is shown in Exhibit 11 5 4 Further Refinement and Final Concept Selection At this stage industrial designers often switch from soft models and sketches to hard models and information intensive drawings known as renderings Renderings show the details of the design and often depict the product in use Drawn in two or three dimensions they convey a great deal of information about the product Renderings are often used for color studies and for testing customers reception to the proposed product s features and functionality A rendering from the project is shown in Exhibit 11 4 The final refinement step before selecting a concept is to create hard models These models are still technically nonfunctional yet are close replicas of the final design with a very realistic look and feel They are made from wood dense foam plastic or metal are painted and textured and have some working features such as buttons that push 1 1 4 Two quick thumbnail concept sketches left and a more detailed colored rendering right showing evolution of the concept EXHIBIT 1 1 5 A soft model left and a hard model right used by the industrial designers to study alternative forms Industrial Design 21 9 Courtesy of Motorola Inc sliders that move Because a hard model can cost thousands of dollars a product development team usually has the budget to make only a few For many types of products hard models are fabricated to have the intended size density weight distribution surface finish and color Hard models can then be used by industrial designers and engineers to further refine the final concept specifications Furthermore these models can also be used to gain additional customer feedback in focus groups to advertise and promote the product at trade shows and to sell the concept to senior management within an organization Exhibit 11 5 shows one of the several hard models built during the development process Extensive usability testing was begun with the hard models Tests identified the need for larger keypad buttons on a thinner phone Designers also realized the need to locate the volume control buttons on the side of the display housing for easier Courtesy of Motorola Inc 220 Chapter I l r i r F F I n 1 access when open rather than on the side of the keypad housing They also found that this location required reversal of the functionality of these buttons when the flip is opened 5 Control Drawings or Models Industrial designers complete their development process by making control drawings or control models of the final concept Control drawings or models document functionality features sizes colors surface finishes and key dimensions Although they are not detailed part drawings known as engineering drawings they can be used to fabricate final design models and other prototypes Typically these drawings or models are given to the engineering team for detailed design of the parts Exhibit 11 6 shows one view of the control model of the final design 6 Coordination with Engineering Manufacturing and External Vendors The industrial designers must continue to work closely with engineering and manufacturing personnel throughout the subsequent product development process Some industrial design consulting firms offer quite comprehensive product development services including detailed engineering design and the selection and management of outside vendors of materials tooling components and assembly services The Impact of Computer Based Tools on the ID Process Since the computer aided design CAD tools have had a significant impact on industrial designers and their work Using modern CAD tools industrial designers can generate display and rapidly modify three dimensional designs on high resolution computer displays In this manner ID can potentially generate a greater number of detailed concepts more quickly which may lead to more innovative design solutions The visual realism of CAD images can enhance communication within the product development team and eliminate much of the inaccuracy of the manually generated sketches historically provided by industrial designers 1992 Furthermore CAD systems may be used to generate control models or drawings and these data can be directly transferred to engineering design systems allowing the entire development process to be more easily integrated Exhibit 11 7 shows a CAD model of the EXHIBIT 1 1 6 WWII E Courtesy of Motorola Inc Side view of the control model defining the final shape and dimensions Industrial Design 221 Courtesy of Motorola Inc EXHIBIT 1 1 7 CAD concept image created using Pro ENGINEER software Management of the Industrial Design Process Industrial design is typically involved in the overall product development process during several different phases The timing of the ID effort depends upon the nature of the product being designed To explain the timing of the ID effort it is convenient to classify products as technology driven products and user driven products Technology driven products The primary characteristic of a technology driven product is that its core benefit is based on its technology or its ability to accomplish a specific technical task While such a product may have important aesthetic or ergonomic requirements consumers will most likely purchase the product primarily for its technical performance For example a hard disk drive for a computer is largely technology driven It follows that for the development team of a technology driven product the engineering or technical requirements will be paramount and will dominate development efforts Accordingly the role of ID is often limited to packaging the core technology This entails determining the product s external appearance and ensuring that the product communicates its technological capabilities and modes of interaction to the user User driven products The core benefit of a user driven product is derived from the functionality of its interface and or its aesthetic appeal Typically there is a high degree of user interaction for these products Accordingly the user interfaces must be safe easy to use and easy to maintain The product s external appearance is often important to differentiate the product and to create pride of ownership For example an Chapter 11 Mobile Phone Super Computer 0 Camera Laptop Computer Coffeemaker 0 Desktop 0 Wristwatch 0 Computer 0 Office Chair Hard Disk Drive 4 Technology Driven User Driven Products Products EXHIBIT 1 1 8 Classification of some common products on the continuum from technology driven product to user driven product chair is largely user driven While these products may be technically sophisticated the technology does not differentiate the product thus for the product development team the ID considerations will be more important than the technical requirements The role of engineering may still be important to determine any technical features of the product however since the technology is often already established the development team focuses on the user aspects of the product Exhibit 11 8 classifies a variety of familiar products Rarely does a product belong at one of the two extremes Instead most products fall somewhere along the continuum These classifications can be dynamic For example when a company develops a product based on a new core technology the company is often interested in bringing the product to market as quickly as possible Because little emphasis is placed on how the product looks or is used the initial role of ID is small However as competitors enter the market the product may need to compete more along user or aesthetic dimensions The product s original classification shifts and ID assumes an extremely important role in the development process One classic example is the Apple laptop computer The core benefit of the first Apple laptop was its technology a highly portable computer using the Macintosh operating system As competition entered this market however Apple relied heavily on ID to create aesthetic appeal and enhanced utility adding to the technical advantages of subsequent models Timing of Industrial Design Involvement Typically ID is incorporated into the product development process during the later phases for a technology driven product and throughout the entire product development process for a user driven product Exhibit 11 9 illustrates these timing differences Note that the ID process is a subprocess of the product development process it is parallel but not separate As shown in the exhibit the ID process described above may be rapid relative to the overall development process The technical nature of the problems that confront engineers in their design activities typically demands substantially more development effort than do the issues considered by ID Exhibit 11 9 shows that for a technology driven product ID activities may begin fairly late in the program This is because ID for such products is focused primarily on packaging issues For a user driven product ID is involved much more fully In fact the ID process may dominate the overall product development process for many user driven products Industrial Design 223 Concept Development

Industrial Design Processes User Driven Products EXHIBIT 1 1 9 Relative timing of the industrial design process for two types of products Exhibit 11 10 describes the responsibilities of ID during each phase of the product development process and how they relate to the other activities of the development team As with the timing of ID involvement the responsibilities of ID may also change according to product type Product Development Activity Type of Product Technology Driven User Driven Identification of Customer Needs Concept Generation and Selection Concept Testing System Level Design Detail Design Testing and Refinement ID typically has no involvement ID works with marketing and engineering to ensure that human factors and user interface issues are addressed Safety and maintenance issues are often of primary importance ID helps engineering to create prototypes which are shown to customers for feedback ID typically has little involvement ID is responsible for packaging the product once most of the engineering details have been addressed ID receives product specifications and constraints from engineering and marketing ID works closely with marketing to identify customer needs Industrial designers participate in focus groups or one on one customer interviews ID generates multiple concepts according to the industrial design process flow described earlier ID leads in the creation of models to be tested with customers by marketing ID narrows down the concepts and refines the most promising approaches ID selects a final concept then coordinates with engineering manufacturing and marketing to finalize the design EXHIBIT 1 1 1 0 The role of industrial design according to product type 224 Chapter 1 1 Assessing the Quality of Industrial Design Assessing the quality of ID for a finished product is an inherently subjective task However we can qualitatively determine whether ID has accomplished its goals by considering each aspect of the product that is influenced by ID Below are five categories for evaluating a product These categories roughly match Dreyfuss s five critical goals for ID presented earlier in this chapter We use these categories to develop specific questions allowing the product to be rated along five dimensions Exhibit 11 11 demonstrates this method by showing results for the 1 Quality of the User Interface This is a rating of how easy the product is to use Interface quality is related to the product s appearance feel and modes of interaction 0 Do the features of the product effectively communicate their operation to the user 0 Is the product s use intuitive 0 Are all features safe 0 Have all potential users and uses of the product been considered Examples of product specific questions include 0 Is the grip comfortable 0 Does the control knob turn easily and smoothly 0 Is the power switch easy to locate 0 Is the display easy to read and understand 2 Emotional Appeal This is a rating of the overall consumer appeal of the product Appeal is achieved in part through appearance feel sound and smell 0 Is the product attractive Is it exciting Does the product express quality What images come to mind when viewing it 0 Does the product inspire pride of ownership Does the product evoke feelings of pride among the development team and sales staff Examples of product specific questions include How does the car door sound when slammed 0 Does the hand tool feel solid and sturdy Does the appliance look good on the kitchen counter 3 Ability to Maintain and Repair the Product This is a rating of the ease of product maintenance and repair Maintenance and repair should be considered along with the other user interactions Industrial Design 225 Assessment Category Performance Rating Explanation of

readily accessible using the navigation buttons The s drawbacks included a keypad that could be difficult to use for customers with large fingers or long fingernails In some markets carriers had specified that Motorola customize the software interface in ways that negatively impacted usability The had a high emotional appeal that stemmed from its ultra thin form and finishes Although maintenance and repair were not of primary importance to the customer the rated high in this category The battery charged very quickly and could be removed and replaced easily The final design included only those features that satisfied real customer needs Materials were selected for durability and to withstand extreme conditions to meet environmental regulations and to create an attractive appearance The s appearance was clearly unique It was easily identified when viewed in a public area or next to a competitor s product EXHIBIT 1 1 1 1 Assessment of industrial design s role in the development project 0 Is the maintenance of the product obvious Is it easy 0 product features effectively communicate disassembly and assembly procedures Examples of product specific questions include How easy and obvious is it to clear a paper jam in the printer 0 How difficult is it to disassemble and clean the food processor How long does it take to change the batteries in the remote controller 226 Chapter 1 1 4 Appropriate Use of Resources This is a rating of how well resources were used in satisfying the customer needs Resources typically refer to the dollar expenditures on ID and other functions These factors tend to drive costs such as manufacturing A poorly designed product one with unnecessary features or a product made from an exotic material will affect tooling manufacturing processes assembly processes and the like This category asks whether these investments were well spent How well were resources used to satisfy the customer requirements 0 Is the material selection appropriate in terms of cost and quality Is the product over or does it have features that are unnecessary or neglected 0 Were environmental ecological factors considered 5 Product Differentiation This is a rating of a product s uniqueness and consistency with the corporate identity This differentiation arises predominantly from appearance Will a customer who sees the product in a store be able to identify it because of its appearance 0 Will it be remembered by a consumer who has seen it in an advertisement 0 Will it be recognized when seen on the street 0 Does the product fit with or enhance the corporate identity From an ID perspective as shown in Exhibit 11 1 1 the was an excellent product It was novel recognizable durable easy to fabricate and had strong customer appeal Since these features were extremely important to the consumer ID played a critical role in determining the immediate market success of the product Summary This chapter introduces the topic of industrial design explains its benefits to product quality and illustrates how the ID process takes place 0 The primary mission of ID is to design the aspects of a product that relate to the user aesthetics and ergonomics 0 Most products can benefit in some way or another from ID The more a product is seen or used by people the more it will depend on good ID for its success For products that are characterized by a high degree of user interaction and the need for aesthetic appeal ID should be involved throughout the product development process Early involvement of industrial designers will ensure that critical aesthetic and user requirements will not be overlooked or ignored by the technical staff When a product s success relies more on technology ID can be integrated into the development process later 0 Active involvement of ID on the product development team can help to promote good communication between functional groups Such communication facilitates coordination and ultimately translates into higher quality products Industrial Design 227 References and Bibliography Many current resources are available on the Internet via u rich net For more information about

Herman Miller s line of office seating products Shown from left to right are the 1994 2004 and 2009 229230 Chapter 12 EXHIBIT 1 2 2 The spine of the chair is a combination of two polypropylene materials precisely engineered to flex and support as the user moves in the chair In June 2009 Herman Miller Inc a U S based office furniture manufacturer launched the multipurpose chair The named after the Hindi word for bridge aims to set new standards of simplicity adaptability and comfort for multipurpose seating while being environmentally friendly The chair is one product in a very successful line of office seating including also the and chairs shown in Exhibit 12 1 Herman Miller designed the chair in collaboration with Studio 7 5 a design firm based in Germany Multipurpose chairs such as the are used where people sit for relatively short periods such as conference rooms temporary workstations and collaborative spaces This is in contrast to a task chair in which the user sits for longer periods Studio 7 5 found that many chairs in office spaces where people spend from a few minutes to a few hours at a time were uncomfortable and Moreover most chairs are made with materials and processes that are harmful to the environment Studio 7 5 recognized a market need for a new and innovative multipurpose chair one combining comfort design for environment and a compelling price The core of is a flexible spine molded of two polypropylene materials and engineered to achieve comfort for nearly everybody see Exhibit 12 2 As the user sits and reclines the spine flexes providing comfort and back support throughout the full range of tilt Without any tilt mechanism and with only one adjustment height the chair is significantly lighter weight less complex and lower cost than the and task chairs The chair emerged from Herman Miller s commitment to minimizing the environmental impacts of their products and operations and provides a great example of how to incorporate environmental considerations into the product development process The is designed for material recycling and is produced using environmentally safe materials and renewable energy The following factors explain its level of environmental performance Environmentally friendly materials The multipurpose chair consists of environmentally safe and nontoxic materials such as 41 percent by weight aluminum 41 percent polypropylene and 18 percent steel Courtesy of Herman Miller Inc Design for Environment 231 Recycled content The is made of 44 percent recycled materials by weight comprising 23 percent and postindustrial recycled content The is 92 percent recyclable by weight at the end of its useful life Steel and aluminum components are 100 percent recyclable Polypropylene components are identified with a recycling code whenever possible to aid in returning these materials to the recycling stream Of course recycling of industrial materials depends on the availability of such recycling streams Clean energy is manufactured on a production line that utilizes 100 percent green power half from wind turbines and half from captured landfill off gassing 0 Emissions No harmful air or water emissions are released during s production Returnable and recyclable packaging components are received by Herman Miller from a network of nearby suppliers in molded tote trays that are returned to the suppliers for reuse Outgoing packaging materials include corrugated cardboard and a polyethylene plastic bag both materials capable of repeated recycling Design for environment is a way to include environmental considerations in the product development process This chapter presents a method for using the Herman Miller chair as an example to illustrate the successful application of the process What Is Design for Environment Every product has environmental impacts provides organizations with a practical method to minimize these impacts in an effort to create a more sustainable society Just as effective design for manufacturing practice has been shown to maintain or improve product quality while reducing costs see Chapter 13 Design for Manufacturing practitioners of have also found that effective practice can maintain or improve product quality and cost while reducing environmental impacts Environmental impacts of a product may include energy consumption natural resource depletion liquid discharges gaseous emissions and solid waste generation These impacts fall into two broad categories energy and materials and both represent critical environmental problems that need to be solved For most products addressing the energy problem means developing products that use less energy and that use renewable energy To address the materials problem is not as straightforward Therefore much of the focus of in this chapter is on choosing the right materials for products and making sure they can be recycled During the early stages of the product development process deliberate decisions about material use energy efficiency and waste avoidance can minimize or eliminate environmental impacts However once the design concept is established improving environmental performance generally involves time consuming design iterations therefore may involve activities throughout the product development process and requires an interdisciplinary approach Industrial design engineering purchasing and marketing all work together in the development of environmentally friendly products In many cases product development professionals with specialized training lead the efforts within a project However all product development team members benefit from understanding the principles of 232 Chapter 12 EXHIBIT 1 2 3 The natural life cycle and the product life cycle Two Life Cycles Life cycle thinking is the basis of This helps to expand the traditional manufacturer s concern with the production and distribution of its products to comprise a system relating the product life cycle to the natural life cycle both of which are illustrated in Exhibit 12 3 The product life cycle begins with the extraction and processing of raw materials from natural resources followed by production distribution and use of the product Finally at the end of the product s useful life there are several recovery options or reuse of components recycling of materials or disposal through incineration or deposit in a landfill The natural life cycle represents the growth and decay of organic materials in a continuous loop The two life cycles intersect as shown in the diagram with the use of natural materials in industrial products and with the reintegration of organic materials back into the natural cycle While most product life cycles take place over a few months or years the natural cycle spans a wider range of time periods Most organic materials plant and animal based can decay relatively quickly and become nutrients for new growth of similar materials However other natural materials such as minerals are created on a much longer time scale and so are considered to be nonrenewable natural resources Therefore depositing most mineral based industrial materials into landfills does not readily re create similar industrial materials for perhaps thousands of years and often creating unnatural concentrations of certain harmful wastes Each of the product life cycle stages may consume energy and other resources and may generate emissions and waste all of which have environmental impacts From this life cycle perspective in order to reach conditions of environmental sustainability the materials in products must be balanced in a sustainable closed loop system This gives rise to three challenges of product design to reach sustainability which are also represented in the life cycle diagram of Exhibit 12 3 Nonrenewable Resources 8 Recycling fl Production Postindustrial Renewable R Materials Resources Natural Recycling Biological Product Natural Life Cycle d t Decay n us Life Cycle Distribution Recovery T Reuse Organics Use for Environment 233 Eliminate use of nonrenewable natural resources including nonrenewable sources of energy Eliminate disposal of synthetic and inorganic materials that do not decay quickly Eliminate creation of toxic wastes that are not part of natural life cycles Organizations committed to intend to work toward achieving these sustainability conditions over time helps these organizations to create better products by choosing materials carefully and by enabling proper recovery options so that the materials used in products can be reintegrated either into the product life cycle or into the natural life cycle Environmental Impacts Every product may have a number of environmental impacts over its life cycle The following list explains some of the environmental impacts deriving from the manufacturing sector adapted from Lewis et 2001 Global warming Scientific data and models show that the temperature of the earth is gradually increasing as a result of the accumulation of greenhouse gases particulates and water vapor in the upper atmosphere This effect appears to be accelerating as a result of emissions of carbon dioxide methane chlorofluorocarbons black carbon particles and nitrogen oxides from industrial processes and products Resource depletion Many of the raw materials used for production such as iron ore gas oil and coal are nonrenewable and supplies are limited Solid waste Products may generate solid waste throughout their life cycle Some of this waste is recycled but most is disposed in incinerators or landfills Incinerators generate air pollution and toxic ash which goes into landfills Landfills may also create concentrations of toxic substances generate methane gas and release groundwater pollutants Water pollution The most common sources of water pollution are discharges from industrial processes which may include heavy metals fertilizers solvents oils synthetic substances acids and suspended solids Waterborne pollutants may affect groundwater drinking water and fragile ecosystems Air pollution Sources of air pollution include emissions from factories plants incinerators residential and commercial buildings and motor vehicles Typical pollutants include sulfur dioxide 02 ozone 03 and volatile organic compounds Land degradation Land degradation concerns the adverse effects that raw material extraction and production such as mining farming and forestry have on the environment The effects include reduced soil fertility soil erosion salinity of land and water and deforestation Biodiversity Biodiversity concerns the variety of plant and animal species and is affected by land clearing for urban development mining and other industrial activities Ozone depletion The ozone layer protects the earth against the harmful effects of the sun s radiation It is degraded by reactions with nitric acid created by the burning of fossil fuels and compounds such as 234 Chapter 12 History of Design for Environment The birth of is often traced to the early 1971 challenged designers to face their social and environmental responsibilities instead of only commercial interests The World Commission on Environment and Development s Report 1987 first defined the term sustainable development as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs In the several influential books about environmentally friendly design were published 1991 argued that there was no longer a conflict between a green approach to design and business success 1996 revised 2009 discussed how integrates life cycle thinking into new product and process development As the process matured and van 1997 provided a practical guide called Also in the the Technical University of Delft Electronics and the Dutch government collaborated to develop a life cycle analysis software tool providing metrics to assess the overall environmental impact of a product Today s sustainable development movement embraces the broader concept of sustainable product design and 2007 which includes not only but also the social and ethical implications of products Even though authors have used various terminology for environmentally friendly design approaches the terms green design sustainable design and are more or less synonymous today Herman Miller s Journey toward Design for Environment Many manufacturing firms have begun to embrace However few have done so to the extent of Herman Miller where is central to its corporate strategy Herman Miller strives to maintain high product quality standards while incorporating increasingly more environmentally friendly materials manufacturing processes and product function into every new product design In 1999 Herman Miller formed a design for environment team This team is responsible for developing environmentally sensitive design standards for new and existing Herman Miller products Design Chemistry a product and industrial process design firm based in Virginia supports the team in its mission and 2002 stated in their book Cradle to Cradle Remaking the Way We Make Things that the traditional approach designing products that are merely less harmful to the environment due to incremental improvements such as reduced energy use waste generation or use of toxic materials is not sufficient because such products are still unhealthy for the environment To advance from less harmful to truly environmentally friendly products and introduced a method that focuses on three key areas of product design Material chemistry What chemicals comprise the specified materials Are they safe for humans and the environment Disassembly Can the products be taken apart at the end of their useful life in order to recycle their materials Do the materials contain recycled content Are the materials readily separable into recycling categories Can the materials be recycled at the end of the product s useful life Design for Environment 235 To implement Herman Miller has built a team of experts who work on every new product development team With they have created a materials database and a assessment tool which provide metrics to guide design decisions throughout the product development process The Design for Environment Process EXHIBIT 1 2 4 The process involves activities throughout the product development process Effective implementation of includes activities throughout the product development process The steps of the process are shown in Exhibit 12 4 Despite the linear presentation of the steps product development teams will likely repeat some steps several times making an iterative process The following sections describe each step of the process Product Planning Concept Development System Level Design 1 Set Agenda l 2 Identify Potential Environmental Impacts l 3 Select Guidelines 4 Apply Guidelines to Initial Detail Design I 5 Assess Environmental Impacts Compare to Goals 6 Refine Design Process Improvement l 7 Reflect on Process and Chapter 12 Step 1 Set the Agenda Drivers Goals and Team The process begins as early as the product planning phase with setting the agenda This step consists of three activities identifying the internal and external drivers of setting the environmental goals for the product and setting up the team By setting the agenda the organization identifies a clear and actionable path toward environmentally friendly product design Identify the Internal and External Drivers of The planning phase of begins with a discussion of the reasons why the organization wishes to address the environmental performance of its products It is useful to document both the internal drivers and the external drivers of This list may evolve over time as changes in technology regulation experience stakeholders and competition each affect the capability and challenges of the organization Internal drivers are the objectives within the organization Typical internal drivers of are adapted from and van 1997 Product quality A focus on environmental performance may raise the quality of the product in terms of functionality reliability in operation durability and Public image Communicating a high level of environmental quality of a product can improve a company s image Cost reduction Using less material and less energy in production can result in considerable cost savings Generating less waste and eliminating hazardous waste results in lower waste disposal costs Innovation Sustainable thinking can lead to radical changes in product design and may foster innovation across the whole company Operational safety By eliminating toxic materials many changes can help improve the occupational health and safety of employees Employee motivation Employees can be motivated to contribute in new and creative ways if they are able to help reduce the environmental impacts of the company s products and operations Ethical responsibility Interest in sustainable development among managers and product developers may be motivated in part by a moral sense of responsibility for conserving the environment and nature Consumer behavior Wider availability of products with positive environmental benefits may accelerate the transition to cleaner lifestyles and demand for greener products External drivers of typically include environmental regulations customer preferences and the offerings of competitors such as from and van 1997 Environmental legislation Product oriented environmental policy is developing rapidly Companies must not only understand the myriad regulations in the various regions where they operate and sell products but also be able to anticipate for Environment 237 legislation The focus of recent legislation is shifting from the prohibition of certain materials to broader producer responsibility including take back obligations Market demand Today companies operate in a business environment of increasingly well informed industrial customers and end users who may demand sustainable products Negative publicity and boycotts of products manufacturers or retailers can have considerable impact on sales Of course the opposite positive effect is becoming more powerful as well Competition Sustainability activities undertaken by competitors can lead to pressure for more emphasis on Setting a high environmental standard may create a advantage Trade organizations Trade or industrial organizations in some branches of industry such as packaging and automobile manufacturing encourage companies to take environmental action by sharing technology and establishing codes of conduct Suppliers Suppliers influence company behavior by introducing more sustainable materials and processes Companies may choose to audit and confirm environmental declarations of their suppliers Social pressures Through their social and community contacts managers and employees may be asked about the responsibility that their business takes for the environment Key drivers for the chair were market demand innovation and Herman Miller s commitment to environmental responsibility Studio 7 5 and Herman Miller developed the early concepts with these drivers in mind Set the Goals An important activity in the product planning phase is to set the environmental goals for each product development project Many organizations have established a strategy that includes long term environmental goals These goals define how the organization complies with environmental regulations and how the organization reduces the environmental impacts of its products services and operations In 2005 Herman Miller set its long term environmental goals for the year 2020 0 Zero landfill Zero hazardous waste generation 0 Zero harmful air emissions 0 Zero process water use 0 All green electrical energy use 0 All buildings certified to meet environmental efficiency standards 0 All sales from products created with the process To achieve the long term goals specific environmental goals may be set for every product during the planning phase These individual goals also allow the organization to make progress toward the long term strategy Exhibit 12 5 lists examples of goals arranged according to the product life cycle Based on an understanding of which life cycle stages contribute significant environmental impacts goals may be developed accordingly 238 Chapter 12 EXHIBIT 1 2 5 Example goals arranged according to the product life cycle stages Adapted from et 2006 Life Cycle Stage Example Design for Environment Goals Reduce the use of raw materials Choose plentiful renewable raw materials Eliminate toxic materials Increase the energy efficiency of material extraction processes Reduce discards and waste Increase the use of recovered and recycled materials Materials Production Reduce the use of process materials Specify process materials that can be fully recovered and recycled Eliminate toxic process materials Select processes with high energy efficiency Reduce production scrap and waste Distribution Plan the most energy efficient shipping Reduce emissions from transport Eliminate toxic and dangerous packaging materials Eliminate or reuse packaging Use Extend useful product life Promote use of products under the intended conditions Enable clean and efficient servicing operations Eliminate emissions and reduce energy consumption during use Recovery Facilitate product disassembly to separate materials Enable the recovery and of components Facilitate material recycling Reduce waste volume for incineration and landfill deposit Herman Miller understands that the primary environmental impacts of their office furniture products are in the materials production and recovery stages For the chair Herman Miller aimed to use exclusively materials with low environmental impact facilitate product disassembly and enable recycling Set Up the Team requires participation by many functional experts on the product development project The typical composition of a team often a within the overall project team consists of a leader an environmental chemistry and materials expert a manufacturing engineer and a representative from the purchasing and supply chain organization Of course the team composition depends on the organization and needs of the specific project and may also include marketing professionals outside consultants suppliers or other experts Herman Miller created their team in 1999 to work with the designers and engineers on every product development project to review material chemistry disassembly incoming and outgoing packaging energy sources and uses and waste generation The team is involved as early as possible to ensure that for Environment 239 are taken into account right from the start By working closely with each product development team the team provides the tools and knowledge for making environmentally sound design decisions Step 2 Identify Potential Environmental Impacts Environmental Impacts A biodiversity due to deforestation Land degradation from factory methane and Emissions and Water pollution Air pollution due groundwater waste generation from factory to transportation Maintenance and pollutants from mining discharges emissions cleaning materials Incineration Natural resource Waste generation Waste generation Abrasion of generates air depletion during production from packaging materials pollution and Within the concept development phase begins by identifying the potential environmental impacts of the product over its life cycle This enables the product development team to consider environmental impacts at the concept stage even though little or no specific data regarding material and energy use emissions and waste generation are yet available for the actual product and a detailed environmental impact assessment is not yet possible In the case of product redesign however relevant data may be provided by impact analysis of some existing products See life cycle assessment methods in step 5 below Exhibit 12 6 shows a chart that can be used to qualitatively assess the environmental impacts over the product life cycle The chart is an adaption of the Wheel and van 1997 and the Web and 2007 To create this chart the team asks What are the significant sources of potential environmental impact in each life cycle stage Specific questions for each stage are given in Exhibit 12 7 and may be helpful in conducting this qualitative analysis The team lists for each life cycle stage the anticipated key environmental impacts The height of each bar in the chart represents the team s judgment about the overall magnitude of the potential environmental impacts and therefore where to focus their efforts For some products e g automobiles electronic devices the most significant impacts are found to be in the use stage For other products e g clothing office furniture the greatest impacts may be in the materials production and recovery stages Exhibit 12 6 shows a qualitative life cycle assessment for office furniture in general This understanding guided in the chair project Waste generation during recovery Reduced process Landfill leads to Air pollution land degradation due to mining emissions Landfill generates Life Cycle toxic ash Materials Production Distribution Use Recovery EXHIBIT 1 2 6 The qualitative life cycle assessment represents the team s estimate of the potential types and magnitudes of environmental impacts of the product over its life cycle This chart depicts the types of impacts most relevant to office furniture products such as the chair 240

of the environmental impacts of each life cycle stage Adapted from and van 1997 Step 3 Select Guidelines Guidelines help product design teams to make early decisions without the type of detailed environmental impact analysis that is only possible after the design is more fully specified Relevant guidelines may be selected based in part on the qualitative assessment of life cycle impacts from step 2 Selecting relevant guidelines during the concept development phase allows the product development team to apply them throughout the product development project Exhibit 12 8 shows a compilation of guidelines based on a study by et 2008 Each life cycle stage has its own guidelines that provide product development teams with instructions on how to reduce the environmental impacts of a product A more detailed list of guidelines is provided in the appendix to this chapter Many of the guidelines relate to selection of materials This underscores the central role of materials in Design for Environment 241 Life Cycle Stage Design for Environment Guidelines Materials Sustainability of resources Specify renewable and abundant resources Specify recyclable and or recycled materials Specify renewable forms of energy Healthy inputs and outputs Specify nonhazardous materials Install protection against release of pollutants and hazardous substances Include labels and instructions for safe handling of toxic materials Production Minimal use of resources in production Employ as few manufacturing steps as possible Specify materials that do not require surface treatments or coatings Minimize the number of components Specify lightweight materials and components Distribution Minimal use of resources in distribution Minimize packaging Use recyclable and or reusable packaging materials Employ folding nesting or disassembly to distribute products in a compact state Apply structural techniques and materials to minimize the total volume of material Use Efficiency of resources during use Implement default power down for subsystems that are not in use Use feedback mechanisms to indicate how much energy or water are being consumed Implement intuitive controls for resource saving features Appropriate durability Consider aesthetics and functionality to ensure the aesthetic life is equal to the technical life Facilitate repair and upgrading Ensure minimal maintenance Minimize failure modes Recovery Disassembly separation and purification Ensure that joints and fasteners are easily accessible Specify joints and fasteners so that they are separable by hand or with common tools Ensure that incompatible materials are easily separated EXHIBIT 1 2 8 Design for environment guidelines arranged according to the life cycle stage of a product Based on et 2008 Guidelines used in the project are identified with an asterisk 242 Chapter 12 For the project the experts provided the product development team with several guidelines These guidelines are identified with an asterisk in Exhibit 12 8 Step 4 Apply the Guidelines to the Initial Product Design EXHIBIT 1 2 9 The spine was inspired by the human backbone As the product architecture is developed during the system level design phase see Chapter 10 Product Architecture some initial material choices are made along with some of the module design decisions It is beneficial therefore to apply the relevant guidelines selected in step 3 at this point In this way the initial product design may have lower environmental impacts The team wanted the chair to be lightweight in order to reduce materials use and transportation impacts application of the guideline Specify lightweight materials and components They achieved this by developing a concept and product architecture that avoided an under seat tilt mechanism and other complexities This helped to reduce the chairs weight by as much as 20 pounds 9 kg The team also looked for new ways to ease the disassembly of the in order to facilitate recycling They placed each joint where it is easily accessible and also ensured that s components are separable by hand or with common tools application of the guidelines Ensure that joints and fasteners are easily accessible Specify joints and fasteners so that they are separable by hand or with common tools In the detail design phase the exact materials specifications detailed geometry and manufacturing processes are determined Application of the guidelines in detail design is essentially the same as in system level design however at this point many more decisions are being made and environmental factors can be considered with greater precision By specifying low impact materials and reducing energy consumption product development teams create more environmentally friendly products Furthermore the guidelines may inspire product development teams to come up with improvement in the functionality and durability of the product which may lead to significant lower environmental impacts The spine geometry shown in Exhibit 12 9 was inspired by the human backbone Studio 7 5 designers prototyped many iterations of the spine in order to achieve proper support and recline see Exhibit 12 10 Once the shape of the spine was set the team had to find materials that suited both the functional and environmental requirements Courtesy of Studio 7 5 and Herman Miller Inc EXHIBIT 1 2 1 0 The design team prototyped many variations of s spine and related components Design for Environment 243 Courtesy of Studio 7 5 and Herman Miller Inc To specify materials that fit the environmental and functional requirements the development team used Herman Miller s proprietary materials database The database maintained together with considers the safety and environmental impacts of each material and classifies them into one of four categories green little to no hazard yellow low to moderate hazard orange incomplete data and red high hazard Herman Miller s aim was to use only materials that rank yellow or green for all new products For example polyvinyl chloride PVC is classified as a red material PVC is a polymer that is commonly used in and other products due to its low cost and high strength However both the production and the incineration of PVC releases toxic emissions To avoid using materials that are toxic to humans and the environment application of the guideline Specify nonhazardous materials the engineers specified safer materials such as polypropylene and avoided PVC entirely Step 5 Assess the Environmental Impacts The next step is to assess to the extent possible the environmental impacts of the product over its entire life cycle To do so with precision requires a detailed understanding of how the product is to be produced distributed used over its lifetime and recycled or Chapter 12 at the end of its useful life This assessment is generally done on the basis of the detailed bill of materials including sources of energy component material specifications suppliers transportation modes waste streams recycling methods and disposal means Several quantitative life cycle assessment tools are available to conduct such an environmental assessment These tools range in price and complexity and would be selected based on the types of materials and processes involved and the precision required of the analysis requires a significant amount of time training and data Many analyses are comparative and provide a basis for considering the environmental performance of product design alternatives Commercial software is becoming widely used in product design and supporting data are available for common materials production processes transport methods energy generation processes and disposal scenarios Herman Miller uses their own proprietary assessment tool developed for them by The tool consists of a spreadsheet interface and the materials database using the color coding described above The tool considers four factors for each component in the product 1 Material chemistry Fraction of the materials by weight that are the safest possible in terms of human toxicity and environmental concerns 2 Recycled content Fraction of the materials by weight that are postindustrial or recycled content 3 Disassembly Fraction of the materials by weight that can be readily disassembled 4 Fraction of the materials by weight that are recyclable Once the initial design was established the chair was divided into modules with different teams assigned to develop each module As each team designed their module the team assessed the design using the tool Compare the Environmental Impacts to Goals This step compares the environmental impacts of the evolving design to the goals established in the planning phase If several design options were created in the phase they may now be compared to judge which one has the lowest environmental impacts Unless the product development team is very experienced in the design will generally have much room for improvement Usually several iterations are required before the team is satisfied that the product is as good as it should be from a perspective Step 6 Refine the Product Design to Reduce or Eliminate the Environmental Impacts The objective of this step and subsequent iterations is to reduce or eliminate any significant environmental impacts through redesign The process repeats until the environmental impacts have been reduced to an acceptable level and the environmental performance fits the goals Redesign for ongoing improvement of may also continue after production begins For the and chairs shown in Exhibit 12 1 1 2 1 1 The final design of the spine left and aluminum base right Design for Environment 245 Courtesy of Herman Miller Inc Miller made several modifications to materials specifications and sources since the initial release of these products reducing their environmental impacts After several design iterations the team developed a way to co mold the spine using two different polypropylene materials that are compatible for recycling without separation The inner and outer rails of the spine are made of a glass composite while the connecting spokes are molded using a more flexible polypropylene and rubber composite see Exhibit 12 11 s aluminum base is an example of minimal design Uncoated and unpolished with no finishing labor and no harmful toxins it is durable and has less environmental impacts than traditionally finished chair bases One of the difficult trade offs addressed in the development of was related to selection of materials for the arms of the chair While they were determined to avoid using PVC the team was not able to mold the arms using all materials such as polypropylene due to concerns of durability and fatigue failure The arms therefore were molded from nylon and over molded with a thermoplastic elastomer Because these materials are not chemically compatible for recycling this decision limited the chair s overall Step 7 Reflect on the Process and Results As with every aspect of the product development process the final activity is to ask How well did we execute the process How can our process be improved What improvements can be made on derivative and future products 246 Chapter 12 Assessment Factor Score Factor Weight Weighted Score Material Chemistry 50 33 3 16 7 Recycled Content 44 8 4 3 7 Disassembly

Herman Miller s assessment tool on a scale of 0 to 100 percent with 100 percent being a truly cradle to cradle product the chair achieved a rating of 72 percent as shown in Exhibit 12 12 The team was pleased with the chair in terms of ease of disassembly and feasibility of recycling Over the course of developing the the chair s score moved up and down and eventually dropped from 99 percent to 92 percent due to the material selection trade off in design of the arms One very important achievement made during the development of the to enable its was a change in the spine s materials Early iterations used dissimilar materials bonded together which could not be recycled The team challenged the team to innovate further The resulting solution is constructed of two materials that are compatible for recycling without separation Unfortunately such a solution could not be developed for the arms and incompatible bonded materials were used there While highly successful in terms of implementing the chair still had some negative environmental impacts particularly in terms of material chemistry and use of recycled content as shown in Exhibit 12 12 This reflects the reality that creating a perfect product from a perspective is a goal that may take years to achieve Effective requires a product development team that strives for continuous improvement The team may be able to further develop the chair to reduce some of the known impacts For example molding the arms entirely using polypropylene would likely improve and reduce cost but would also require addressing several very challenging technical issues To further improve their process Herman Miller began to use software to monitor their results and to guide further refinement of their products They next planned to integrate carbon footprint into their tool The carbon footprint of a product is the amount of greenhouse gas emissions caused by the product usually expressed in terms of the equivalent mass of emitted The consideration of carbon footprint would further affect Herman Miller s material choices For example based only on and environmental toxicity aluminum is an environmentally friendly material However considering the carbon footprint of aluminum it may be a less favorable choice compared to steel for example due to the amount of energy required to produce new aluminum Recycled aluminum however uses much less energy so this analysis also depends upon the sources of the materials and energy used to process the metals Design for Environment 247 Summary Every product has environmental impacts over its life cycle Design for environment provides companies with a practical method to minimize or eliminate these environmental impacts 0 Effective maintains or improves product quality and cost while reducing environ mental impacts expands the traditional manufacturer s focus to consider the full product life cycle and its relationship to the environment It begins with the extraction and processing of raw materials from natural resources followed by production distribution and use of the product Finally at the end of the product s useful life are several recovery options or reuse of components recycling of materials or disposal through incineration or deposition in a landfill to reintegrate the product into a cycle may involve activities throughout the product development process and requires an interdisciplinary approach Industrial design engineering purchasing and marketing all work together in the development of environmentally friendly products The process consists of seven steps Product development teams will likely repeat some steps several times Set the agenda drivers goals and team Identify potential environmental impacts Select

EXHIBIT 1 3 1 The General Motors 3 8 liter engine 253254 Chapter 13 EXHIBIT 1 3 2 The original and redesigned air intake manifolds The body of the original manifold top is made of cast aluminum The redesigned manifold bottom is made of molded thermoplastic composite General Motors Division manufactures about 3 500 3 8 liter engines every day Exhibit 13 1 Facing such high production volumes the company had a strong interest in reducing the cost of the engine while simultaneously enhancing its quality A team was formed to improve one of the most expensive in the engine the air intake manifold The intake manifold s primary function is to route air from the throttle to the intake valves at the cylinders The original and redesigned intake manifold assemblies are shown in Exhibit 13 2 This chapter presents a method of design for manufacturing using the GM intake manifold as an example Photos by Stuart for Manufacturing 255 Design for Manufacturing Defined Customer needs and product specifications are useful for guiding the concept phase of product development however during the later development activities teams often have difficulty linking needs and specifications to the specific design issues they face For this reason many teams practice design for X methodologies where X may correspond to one of dozens of quality criteria such as reliability robustness serviceability environmental impact or The most common of these methodologies is design for manufacturing which is of universal importance because it directly addresses manufacturing costs This chapter is primarily about but it is also intended to illustrate by example these general principles which apply to methodologies for achieving any of the in Detail design decisions can have substantial impact on product quality and cost 0 Development teams face multiple and often conflicting goals 0 It is important to have metrics with which to compare alternative designs 0 Dramatic improvements often require substantial creative efforts early in the process 0 A well defined method assists the decision making process Manufacturing cost is a key determinant of the economic success of a product In simple terms economic success depends on the profit margin earned on each sale of the product and on how many units of the product the firm can sell Profit margin is the difference between the manufacturer s selling price and the cost of making the product The number of units sold and the sales price are to a large degree determined by the overall quality of the product Economically successful design is therefore about ensuring high product quality while minimizing manufacturing cost is one method for achieving this goal effective practice leads to low manufacturing costs without sacrificing product quality See Chapter 17 Product Development Economics for a more detailed discussion of models relating manufacturing costs to economic success Requires a Cross Functional Team Design for manufacturing is one of the most integrative practices involved in product development utilizes information of several types including 1 sketches drawings product specifications and design alternatives 2 a detailed understanding of production and assembly processes and 3 estimates of manufacturing costs production volumes and ramp up timing therefore requires the contributions of most members of the development team as well as outside experts efforts commonly draw upon expertise from manufacturing engineers cost accountants and production personnel in addition to product designers Many companies use structured team based workshops to facilitate the integration and sharing of views required for ls Performed throughout the Development Process begins during the concept development phase when the product s functions and specifications are being determined When choosing a product concept cost is almost always one of the criteria on which the decision is made even though cost estimates at this phase are highly subjective and approximate When product specifications Chapter 13 finalized the team makes trade offs between desired performance characteristics For example weight reduction may increase manufacturing costs At this point the team may have an approximate bill of materials a list of parts with estimates of costs During the system level design phase of development the team makes decisions about how to break up the product into individual components based in large measure on the expected cost and manufacturing complexity implications Accurate cost estimates finally become available during the detail design phase of development when many more decisions are driven by manufacturing concerns Overview of the Process Our method is illustrated in Exhibit 13 3 It consists of five steps plus iteration Estimate the manufacturing costs Reduce the costs of components Reduce the costs of assembly Reduce the costs of supporting production 9 Consider the impact of decisions on other factors As shown in Exhibit 13 3 the method begins with the estimation of the manufacturing cost of the proposed design This helps the team to determine at a general level which aspects of the design components assembly or support are most costly The team then directs its attention to the appropriate areas in the subsequent steps This process is iterative It is not unusual to recompute the manufacturing cost estimate and to improve the design of the product dozens of times before agreeing that it is good enough As long as the product design is improving these iterations may continue even until pilot production begins At some point the design is frozen or released and any further modifications are considered formal engineering changes or become part of the next generation of the product In the next section we use the original GM intake manifold as an example and explain how manufacturing costs are determined Then recognizing that accurate cost estimates are difficult if not impossible to obtain we present several useful methods for reducing the costs of components assembly and production support We use the redesigned intake manifold and other products as examples to illustrate these principles Finally we discuss the results achieved through and some of the broader implications of decisions Step 1 Estimate the Manufacturing Costs Exhibit 13 4 shows a simple input output model of a manufacturing system The inputs include raw materials purchased components employees efforts energy and equipment The outputs include finished goods and waste Manufacturing cost is the sum of all of the expenditures for the inputs of the system and for disposal of the wastes produced by the system As the metric of cost for a product firms generally use unit manufacturing cost which is computed by dividing the total manufacturing costs for some period usually a quarter or a year by the number of units of the product manufactured during that period This simple concept is complicated in practice by several issues EXHIBIT 1 3 3 The design for manufacturing method Design for Manufacturing 257 Proposed Design

the Manufacturing Costs N Good Enough Y Acceptable Design 0 What are the boundaries of the manufacturing system Should the field service operations be included What about product development activities How do we charge the product for the use of expensive general purpose equipment that lasts for many years How are costs allocated among more than one product line in large manufacturing systems These are issues around which much of the field of managerial accounting is built and we do not treat them in depth here Nevertheless we will be mindful of these complications as we discuss cost and in this chapter 258 Chapter 13 EXHIBIT 1 3 4 A simple input output model of a manufacturing system Equipment Information Tooling ill Labor MANUFACTURING SYSTEM Finished Goods Raw Materials Purchased Components Energy Supplies Services Waste Exhibit 13 5 shows one way of categorizing the elements of manufacturing cost Under this scheme the unit manufacturing cost of a product consists of costs in three categories 1 Component costs The components of a product also simply called parts of the product may include standard parts purchased from suppliers Examples of standard components include motors switches electronic chips and screws Other components are custom parts made according to the manufacturer s design from raw materials such as sheet steel plastic pellets or aluminum bars Some custom components are made in the manufacturer s own plant while others may be produced by suppliers according to the manufacturer s design specifications 2 Assembly costs Discrete goods are generally assembled from parts The process of assembling almost always incurs labor costs and may also incur costs for equipment and tooling Manufacturing Cost Components Assembly Overhead Standard Equipment Indirect Custom Labor Support Allocation Raw Material Processing Tooling EXHIBIT 1 3 5 Elements of the manufacturing cost of a product Design for Manufacturing 259 3 Overhead costs Overhead is the category used to encompass all of the other costs We find it useful to distinguish between two types of overhead support costs and other indirect allocations Support costs are the costs associated with materials handling quality assurance purchasing shipping receiving facilities and equipment tooling maintenance among others These are the support systems required to manufacture the product and these costs do greatly depend upon the product design Nevertheless because these costs are often shared by more than one product line they are lumped together in the category of overhead Indirect allocations are the costs of manufacturing that cannot be directly linked to a particular product but that must be paid for to be in business For example the salary of the security guard and the cost of maintenance to the building and grounds are indirect costs because these activities are shared among several different products and are difficult to allocate directly to a specific product Because indirect costs are not specifically linked to the design of the product they are not relevant to even though they do contribute to the cost of the product Transportation Costs The model of manufacturing cost in Exhibit 13 5 does not include any costs for transporting finished goods through the distribution system Manufacturing often occurs at a location a great distance from the eventual customer Although the method presented here does not explicitly include transportation expense estimating those costs is relatively easy For instance most goods are transported overseas using standard shipping containers which hold about 70 cubic meters of cargo In most cases these containers are shipped from one location to another at a fixed cost Currently the cost of shipping a container between Asia and the United States is roughly 6 000 resulting in a shipping cost rate of 86 Rates for air freight and trucking although based on a combination of weight and volume are also readily available Based on these rates the product design team can easily include transportation costs in its analysis and doing so may be warranted when the team faces design decisions involving the physical volume or weight of the product Fixed Costs versus Variable Costs Another way to divide manufacturing costs is between fixed costs and variable costs Fixed costs are those that are incurred in a predetermined amount regardless of how many units of the product are manufactured Purchasing the injection mold required for the new intake manifold is an example of a fixed cost Whether 1 000 or 1 million units are produced the fixed cost of the mold is incurred and does not change Another example is the cost of setting up the factory work area for the intake manifold assembly line This cost is also fixed regardless of how many units are produced Despite the terminology however no cost is truly fixed If we quadruple the production quantity we may have to build another production line Conversely we may be able to consolidate two assembly cells if we cannot use all the capacity due to dramatically lower production quantities When considering a cost as fixed ranges of production quantities and the assumed time horizon should be specified Variable costs are those incurred in direct proportion to the number of units produced For example the cost of raw materials is directly proportional to how many Chapter 13 manifolds are produced and therefore to how many 3 8 liter engines are made Assembly labor is sometimes considered a variable cost as well because many firms can adjust the staffing of assembly operations by shifting workers to other areas on short notice The Bill of Materials Because manufacturing cost estimation is fundamental to it is useful to keep this information well organized Exhibit 13 6 shows an information system for recording manufacturing cost estimates It basically consists of a bill of materials augmented with cost information The usually pronounced bomb is a list of each individual component in the product Frequently the is created using an indented format in which the assembly tree structure is illustrated by the indentation of components and subassembly names The columns of the show the cost estimates broken down into fixed and variable costs The variable costs may include materials machine time and labor Fixed costs consist of tooling and other nonrecurring expenses such as specialized equipment and one time setup costs The tooling lifetime is used to compute the unit fixed cost unless the tool s expected lifetime exceeds the product s lifetime volume in which case the lower product volume is used To compute total cost overhead is added according to the firm s accepted cost accounting scheme Note that additional fixed costs such as depreciation of capital equipment used for several products are often also included in the overhead charge Processing Total Unit Tooling Tooling Total Unit Purchased

cost estimates for the original intake manifold and related components The exhaust gas recirculation positive crankcase ventilation and vacuum block components are included here to facilitate comparison with the redesigned manifold assembly Design for Manufacturing 261 Estimating the Costs of Standard Components The costs of standard components are estimated by either 1 comparing each part to a substantially similar part the firm is already producing or purchasing in comparable volumes or 2 soliciting price quotes from vendors or suppliers The costs of minor components e g bolts springs and inserts are usually obtained from the firm s experience with similar components while the costs of or components are usually obtained from vendor quotes In obtaining price quotes the estimated production quantities are extremely important For example the unit price on a purchase of a dozen screws or inserts may be 10 times higher than the unit prices paid by GM when purchasing 100 000 of these parts every month If the anticipated production quantities are high enough an application engineer or sales engineer is usually quite willing to work with the development team to specify a component properly For internally fabricated standard components if the required quantities are high there may not be available production capacity necessitating the purchase of additional equipment or the use of outside suppliers Some suppliers will design and fabricate a custom variation to a standard component if production quantities are high enough For example small electric motors such as those found in powered hand tools are often designed and built specifically for the product application If the production quantities are high enough say 100 000 per year in this case these custom motors are quite economical 1 to 5 per unit depending on the performance characteristics For the intake manifold the volumes are sufficiently high that custom studs bushings and other parts may not cost much more than standard components However as we discuss later introducing new parts can add substantial cost and complexity to the production system and field service operations which increases the support costs Vendors for most standard components can be found in the Thomas Register of American Manufacturers or by looking for company names on components used in related products To obtain a price quote first request a catalog or product literature now generally available on the Internet Then either choose a part number or if a custom component will be used write a one page description of the requirements of the component Next telephone the vendor ask to speak to someone in sales and request price information Make sure to inform vendors that the information is for estimation purposes only otherwise they may claim they do not have enough information to determine exact prices Estimating the Costs of Custom Components Custom components which are parts designed especially for the product are made by the manufacturer or by a supplier Most custom components are produced using the same types of production processes as standard components e g injection molding stamping machining however custom parts are typically special purpose parts useful only in a particular manufacturer s products When the custom component is a single part we estimate its cost by adding up the costs of raw materials processing and tooling In cases where the custom component is actually an assembly of several parts then we consider it a product in and of itself to arrive at the cost of this product we estimate the cost of each subcomponent and then add assembly and overhead costs these costs are described below For the purposes of this explanation we assume the component is a single part The raw materials costs can be estimated by computing the mass of the part allowing for some scrap e g 5 percent to 50 percent for an injection molded part and 25 Chapter 13 EXHIBIT 1 3 7 Cost estimate for the original intake manifold Note that the processing costs for casting and machining reflect the costs for a complete casting line and several machining stations Variable Cost Materials 5 7 kg

unit mass of the raw material A table of raw material costs is given in Appendix A Exhibit 13 17 Processing costs include costs for the s of the processing machinery as well as the cost of using the equipment itself Most standard processing equipment costs between 25 per hour a simple stamping press and 75 per hour a medium sized computer controlled milling machine to operate including depreciation maintenance utilities and labor costs Estimating the processing time generally requires experience with the type of equipment to be used However it is useful to understand the range of typical costs for common production processes For this purpose tables of approximate processing times and costs are given in Appendix B for a variety of stampings castings injection moldings and machined parts Tooling costs are incurred for the design and fabrication of the cutters molds dies or fixtures required to use certain machinery to fabricate parts For example an injection molding machine requires a custom injection mold for every different type of part it produces These molds generally range in cost from 10 000 to 500 000 Approximate tooling costs are also given for the parts listed in Appendix B The unit tooling cost is simply the cost of the tooling divided by the number of units to be made over the life of the tool A high quality injection mold or stamping die can usually be used for a few million parts The cost of the original intake manifold s machined casting is estimated as shown in Exhibit 13 7 Note that the estimate reveals that the cost is dominated by the expense of the aluminum material We will see that the redesign using a composite material not only reduced the material costs but also eliminated machining and allowed many features to be formed into the molded body Estimating the Cost of Assembly Products made of more than one part require assembly For products made in quantities of less than several hundred thousand units per year this assembly is almost always performed manually One exception to this generalization is the assembly of electronic circuit boards which is now almost always done automatically even at relatively low volumes Manual assembly costs can be estimated by summing the estimated time of each assembly operation and multiplying by a labor rate Assembly operations require from about 4 seconds to about 60 seconds each depending upon the size of the parts 1 3 8 Assembly cost estimation for the valve assembly of the redesigned intake manifold Design for Manufacturing 263 Component Quantity Handling Time

tables in and 1989 difficulty of the operation and the production quantities At high volumes workers can specialize in a particular set of operations and special fixtures and tools can assist the assembly Appendix C contains a table of approximate times for manual assembly of various products which is helpful in estimating the range of times required for assembly operations A popular method for estimating assembly times has been developed over the past 30 years by Inc and is now available as a software tool This system involves a tabular information system for keeping track of the estimated assembly times for each part The system is supported by a comprehensive database of standard handling and insertion times for a wide range of situations Special software is also available for estimating the assembly cost of electronic circuit boards Assembly labor can cost from less than 1 per hour in low wage countries to more than 40 per hour in some industrialized nations In the United States assembly labor is likely to cost between 10 and 20 per hour Each firm has different assembly labor cost structures and some industries such as the automobile and aircraft industries have substantially higher cost structures These figures include an allowance for benefits and other worker related expenses and are meant to reflect the true cost to the firm of assembly labor Consider the redesigned intake manifold The assembly cost of the positive crankcase ventilation valve assembly is estimated as shown in Exhibit 13 8 Estimating the Overhead Costs Accurately estimating overhead costs for a new product is difficult and the industry practices are not very satisfying Nevertheless we will describe the standard industry practice here and identify some of its problems Applying the overhead estimation schemes used by most firms is simple Estimating the actual overhead costs incurred by the firm due to a particular product is not The indirect costs of supporting production are very difficult to track and assign to particular product lines The future costs of supporting production are even more difficult to predict for a new product Most firms assign overhead charges by using overhead rates also called burden rates Overhead rates are typically applied to one or two cost drivers Cost drivers are parameters of the product that are directly measurable Overhead charges are added to direct costs in proportion to the drivers Common cost drivers are the cost of any purchased materials the cost of assembly labor and the number of hours of equipment time the product consumes For example the overhead rate for purchased materials might be 10 percent and the overhead rate for assembly labor might be 80 percent Of course purchased components already have the vendor s overhead included in the price we only add the purchasing overhead Under these conditions a product containing 100 of purchased components and 10 of assembly labor would incur 18 of overhead Chapter 13 10 percent of 100 plus 80 percent of 10 Some typical overhead structures are given in Appendix D for different types of products and firms The problem with this scheme is that it implies that overhead costs are directly proportional to the cost drivers A thought experiment reveals that this cannot always be so Most firms use cost of purchased materials as one cost driver yet why would any of their overhead costs actually change if a vendor of a 50 component raises its price to 60 The answer is that they would not change at all Overhead rates are used as a convenient way to account for overhead costs but this scheme can yield inaccurate estimates of the true costs experienced by the manufacturer to support production This problem is partially addressed by activity based costing ABC methods Kaplan 1990 Under the ABC approach a firm utilizes more and different cost drivers and allocates all indirect costs to the associated cost drivers where they fit best As a result the firm may have overhead rates applied to various dimensions of product complexity such as the number of different machining operations required or the number of different components or suppliers needed in addition to overhead on tooling materials machine time and direct labor For the purposes of estimating manufacturing costs the use of more cost drivers not only allows more accurate overhead cost estimates to be made but also provides important insights for reducing overhead costs by focusing attention on the cost drivers Step 2 Reduce the Costs of Components For most highly engineered discrete goods the cost of purchased components will be the most significant element of the manufacturing cost This section presents several strategies for minimizing these costs Many of these strategies can be followed even without the benefit of accurate cost estimates In this case these strategies become design rules or rules of thumb to guide cost reduction decisions Understand the Process Constraints and Cost Drivers Some component parts may be costly simply because the designers did not understand the capabilities cost drivers and constraints of the production process For example a designer may specify a small internal corner radius on a machined part without realizing that physically creating such a feature requires an expensive electro discharge machining operation A designer may specify dimensions with excessively tight tolerances without understanding the difficulty of achieving such accuracy in production Sometimes these costly part features are not even necessary for the component s intended function they arise out of lack of knowledge It is often possible to redesign the part to achieve the same performance while avoiding costly manufacturing steps however to do this the design engineer needs to know what types of operations are difficult in production and what drives their costs In some cases the constraints of a process can be concisely communicated to designers in the form of design rules For example the capabilities of an automatic laser cutting machine for sheet metal can be concisely communicated in terms of allowable material types material thicknesses maximum part dimensions minimum slot widths and cutting accuracy When this is possible part designers can avoid exceeding the normal capabilities of a process and thereby avoid incurring unusually high costs For some processes the cost of producing a part is a simple mathematical function of some attributes of the part which would be the cost drivers for the process For example EXHIBIT 1 3 9 Cost estimate for the redesigned intake manifold two moldings Design for Manufacturing 265 Variable Cost Materials manifold housing 1 4 kg glass filled nylon at 2 75 kg 3 85

welding process could have a cost directly proportional to two attributes of the product 1 the number of welds and 2 the total length of welds the machine creates For processes whose capabilities are not easily described the best strategy is to work closely with the people who deeply understand the part production process These manufacturing experts will generally have plenty of ideas about how to redesign components to reduce production costs Redesign Components to Eliminate Processing Steps Careful scrutiny of the proposed design may lead to suggestions for redesign that can result in simplification of the production process Reducing the number of steps in the part fabrication process generally results in reduced costs as well Some process steps may simply not be necessary For example aluminum parts may not need to be painted especially if they will not be Visible to the user of the product In some cases several steps may be eliminated through substitution of an alternative process step A common example of this strategy is net shape fabrication A net shape process is one that produces a part with the final intended geometry in a single manufacturing step Typical examples include molding casting forging and extrusion Frequently designers are able to use one of the net shape processes to create a part that is very close to the final requirement near net shape and may demand only minor additional processing e g drilling and tapping a hole cutting to length The original intake manifold required an expensive casting followed by several machining operations The redesigned manifold is molded in two parts to net shape The cost estimate for these two moldings is shown in Exhibit 13 9 Compare with Exhibit 13 7 Choose the Appropriate Economic Scale for the Part Process The manufacturing cost of a product usually drops as the production volume increases This phenomenon is labeled economies of scale Economies of scale for a fabricated component occur for two basic reasons 1 fixed costs are divided among more units and 2 variable costs become lower because the firm can justify the use of larger and more efficient processes and equipment For example consider an injection molded plastic part The part may require a mold that costs 50 000 If the firm produces 50 000 units of the part over the product s lifetime each part will have to assume 1 of the cost of the mold If however 100 000 units are produced each part will assume only 0 50 of Chapter 13 EXHIBIT 13 10 Total cost of a hypothetical part as a function of the number of units produced for injection molding versus machining Machining 10 Unit Materials and Processing Injection Molding 1 Unit Materials and Processing Total Cost fl Mold Cost of 10 000 Fixture i Cost of I l 1 000 T 1 000 Units Number of Units Produced cost of the mold As production volumes increase further the firm may be able to justify a four cavity mold for which each cycle of the molding machine produces four parts instead of one As shown in Exhibit 13 9 the tooling costs for the redesigned intake manifold are quite high however spread over the life of the tool the unit fixed cost is small Processes can be thought of as incurring fixed and variable costs Fixed costs are incurred once per part type regardless of how many parts are produced Variable costs are incurred each time a part is made Processes with inherently low fixed costs and high variable costs such as machining are appropriate when few parts will be made while processes with inherently high fixed costs and low variable costs such as injection molding are appropriate when many parts will be made This concept is illustrated by the graph in Exhibit 13 10 As shown in the exhibit if production volume is expected to be below 1 000 units machining would be more economical otherwise injection molding would incur lower total costs Standardize Components and Processes The principle of economies of scale also applies to the selection of components and processes As the production volume of a component increases the unit cost of the component decreases Quality and performance often increase as well with increasing production quantities because the producer of the component can invest in learning and improvement of the component s design and its production process For a given expected product volume the benefits of substantially higher component volumes can be achieved through the use of standard components Standard components are those common to more than one product This standardization may occur within the product line of a single firm or may occur via an outside supplier across the product lines of several firms For example the use of the 3 8 liter engine in several GM cars is an example of internal standardization The use of a common millimeter socket head cap screw across several auto manufacturers is an example of external standardization In either case all other things being equal the component unit cost is lower than if the component were used in only a single product EXHIBIT 13 1 1 An example of standardization within a model Wheels of the Ford Explorer are the same on the right and sides of the car Design for Manufacturing 267 Courtesy of Ford Motor Co The redesigned intake manifold is used on all of GM s 3 8 liter engines even though each particular vehicle application requires different exhaust gas recirculation return and vacuum hose routings To accommodate this the new intake manifold has two standard interfaces a vacuum port and an port For each vehicle model a custom vacuum block and adapter are used This allows the major component the intake manifold to be standardized internally rather than using a different manifold for each vehicle Components may also be standardized within the same model For example most auto manufacturers use the same type of wheel on the right and left side of their cars even though this causes directional spokes to have different orientations on different sides Exhibit 13 11 Adhere to Black Box Component Procurement A component cost reduction strategy used effectively in the Japanese auto industry is called black box supplier design Under this approach the team provides a supplier with only a black box description of the component a description of what the component has to do not how to achieve it Clark and 1991 This kind of specification leaves the vendor with the widest possible latitude to design or select the component for minimum cost An additional advantage of this approach is that it relieves the internal team of the responsibility to engineer and design the component Successful black box development efforts require careful system level design and extremely clear definitions of the functions interfaces and interactions of each component See Chapter 10 Product Architecture For the redesigned intake manifold the valve assembly was designed by GM s AC Rochester Division which supplies the component The supplier was given specifications and complete responsibility for the performance of this subsystem 268 Chapter 13 Step 3 Reduce the Costs of Assembly Design for assembly is a fairly well established subset of that involves minimizing the cost of assembly For most products assembly contributes a relatively small fraction of the total cost Nevertheless focusing attention on assembly costs yields strong indirect benefits Often as a result of emphasis on the overall parts count manufacturing complexity and support costs are all reduced along with the assembly cost In this section we present a few principles useful to guide decisions Keeping Score and 1989 advocate maintaining an ongoing estimate of the cost of assembly In addition to this absolute score they propose the concept of assembly efficiency This is measured as an index that is the ratio of the theoretical minimum assembly time to an estimate of the actual assembly time for the product This concept is useful in developing an intuition for what drives the cost of assembly The expression for the index is index Theoretical minimum number of parts X 3 seconds Estimated total assembly time To determine the theoretical minimum number of parts ask the following three questions of each part in the proposed assembly Only parts satisfying one or more of these conditions must theoretically be separate 1 Does the part need to move relative to the rest of the assembly Small motions that can be accomplished using compliance e g elastic hinges or springs do not count 2 Must the part be made of a different material from the rest of the assembly for fundamental physical reasons 3 Does the part have to be separated from the assembly for assembly access replacement or repair The 3 seconds in the numerator reflects the theoretical minimum time required to handle and insert a part that is perfectly suited for assembly One can think of this as the average time sustainable over a whole work shift required to assemble a small part that is easy to grasp requires no particular orientation and demands no special insertion effort such an operation is as fast as placing a ball into a circular hole with adequate clearance Integrate Parts If a part does not qualify as one of those theoretically necessary then it is a candidate for physical integration with one or more other parts The resulting component is often very complex as a result of the integration of several different geometric features that would otherwise be separate parts Nevertheless molded or stamped parts can often incorporate additional features at little or no added cost Exhibit 13 12 shows the end of the redesigned intake manifold Integrated into this component are the attachments for the return and the vacuum source block These attachments use a molded push in and turn geometry eliminating the need for several threaded fasteners Part integration provides several benefits Integrated parts do not have to be assembled In effect the assembly of the geometric features of the part is accomplished by the part fabrication process EXHIBIT 13 12 Integration of several features into a single component The return and vacuum source ports are molded into the redesigned intake manifold 269 Design for Manufacturing Photo by Stuart Cohen Integrated parts are often less expensive to fabricate than are the separate parts they replace For molded stamped and cast parts this cost savings occurs because a single complex mold or die is usually less expensive than two or more less complex molds or dies and because there is usually less processing time and scrap for the single integrated part Integrated parts allow the relationships among critical geometric features to be controlled by the part fabrication process e g molding rather than by an assembly process This usually means that these dimensions can be more precisely controlled Note however that part integration is not always a wise strategy and may be in con with other sound approaches to minimizing costs For example the main intake manifold assembly on the old design was a single cast piece requiring extensive machining The team replaced this part with two less expensive injection molded pieces This is an example of disintegrating parts in order to achieve benefits in the piece part production costs Maximize Ease of Assembly Two products with an identical number of parts may nevertheless differ in required assembly time by a factor of two or three This is because the actual time to grasp orient and insert a part depends on the part geometry and the required trajectory of the part insertion The ideal characteristics of a part for an assembly are adapted from and 1989 Part is inserted from the top of the assembly This attribute of a part and assembly is called z axis assembly By using z axis assembly for all parts the assembly never has to be inverted gravity helps to stabilize the partial assembly and the assembly worker can generally see the assembly location 270 Chapter 13 Part is self aligning Parts that require fine positioning in order to be assembled require slow precise movements on the part of the assembly worker Parts and assembly sites can be designed to be self aligning so that fine motor control is not required of the worker The most common self alignment feature is the chamfer A chamfer can be implemented as a tapered lead on the end of a peg or a conical widening at the opening of a hole Part does not need to be oriented Parts requiring correct orientation such as a screw require more assembly time than parts requiring no orientation such as a sphere In the worst case a part must be oriented correctly in three dimensions For example the following parts are listed in order of increasing requirements for orientation sphere cylinder capped cylinder capped and keyed cylinder Part requires only one hand for assembly This characteristic relates primarily to the size of the part and the effort required to manipulate the part All other things being equal parts requiring one hand to assemble require less time than parts requiring two hands which in turn require less effort than parts requiring a crane or lift to assemble Part requires no tools Assembly operations requiring tools such as attaching snap rings springs or cotter pins generally require more time than those that do not Part is assembled in a single linear motion Pushing in a pin requires less time than driving a screw For this reason numerous fasteners are commercially available that require only a single linear motion for insertion Part is secured immediately upon insertion Some parts require a subsequent securing operation such as tightening curing or the addition of another part Until the part is secured the assembly may be unstable requiring extra care fixtures or slower assembly Consider Customer Assembly Customers may tolerate completing some of the product assembly themselves especially if doing so provides other benefits such as making the purchase and handling of the packaged product easier However designing a product such that it can be easily and properly assembled by the most inept customers many of whom will ignore directions is a substantial challenge in itself Step 4 Reduce the Costs of Supporting Production In working to minimize the costs of components and the costs of assembly the team may also achieve reductions in the demands placed on the production support functions For example a reduction in the number of parts reduces the demands on inventory management A reduction in assembly content reduces the number of workers required for production and therefore reduces the cost of supervision and human resource management Standardized components reduce the demands on engineering support and quality control There are in addition some direct actions the team can take to reduce the costs of supporting production It is important to remember that manufacturing cost estimates are often insensitive to many of the factors that actually drive overhead charges Recall the discussion of overhead cost estimation above Nevertheless the goal of the design team in this for Manufacturing 271 Drivers of Complexity Rev 1 Rev 2 Number of new parts introduced to the manufacturing system 6 5 Number of new vendors introduced to the manufacturing system 3 2 Number of custom parts introduced to the manufacturing system 2 3 Number of new major tools e g molds and dies introduced to the manufacturing system 2 2 Number of new production processes introduced to the manufacturing system 0 0 Total 13 12 EXHIBIT 1 3 1 3 Scorecard of manufacturing complexity should be to reduce the actual costs of production support even if overhead cost estimates do not change Minimize Systemic Complexity An extremely simple manufacturing system would utilize a single process to transform a single raw material into a single part perhaps a system extruding a single diameter of plastic rod from plastic pellets Unfortunately few such systems exist Complexity arises from variety in the inputs outputs and transforming processes Many real manufacturing systems involve hundreds of suppliers thousands of different parts hundreds of people dozens of types of products and dozens of types of production processes Each variant of suppliers parts people products and processes introduces complexity to the system These variants must usually be tracked monitored managed inspected handled and inventoried at tremendous cost to the enterprise Much of this complexity is driven by the design of the product and can therefore be minimized through smart design decisions Exhibit 13 13 shows a simple scorecard of manufacturing complexity useful for reminding designers of how the product design drives the complexity of the manufacturing system The team establishes a score for the initial design and then uses changes in the score as a measure of success in reducing complexity Note that the drivers given in the scorecard shown are generic categories In practice the team develops this list and may prioritize it with weightings based on the realities and constraints of the firm s production environment Firms that use activity based costing usually know quite well their primary drivers of complexity as these are the cost drivers they use in allocating overhead As a simple substitute for an accurate support cost model such a scorecard allows the team to make informed decisions without formally estimating the indirect costs of production Error Proofing An important aspect of is to anticipate the possible failure modes of the production system and to take appropriate corrective actions early in the development process This strategy is known as error proofing One type of failure mode arises from having slightly different parts that can be easily confused Examples of slightly different parts are screws differing only in the pitch of the threads e g 4 X 70 mm and 4 X 75 mm screws or in the direction of turning left and right handed threads parts that are mirror images of each other and parts differing only in material composition We recommend either that these subtle differences be eliminated or that slight differences be exaggerated Exhibit 13 14 shows an example of exaggerating subtle differences between parts the left and right versions of the reel lock on a Videocassette which Chapter 13 EXHIBIT 1 3 1 4 Left and right reel locks inside a videocassette top center The two nearly identical parts are color coded to avoid confusion Photo by Stuart Cohen mirror images of each other are molded in two different colors Color coding allows the parts to be identified easily and differentiated in materials handling and assembly Step 5 Consider the Impact of Decisions on Other Factors Minimizing manufacturing cost is not the only objective of the product development process The economic success of a product also depends on the quality of the product the timeliness of product introduction and the cost of developing the product There may also be situations in which the economic success of a project is compromised in order to maximize the economic success of the entire enterprise In contemplating a decision these issues should be considered explicitly The Impact of on Development Time Development time can be precious For an automobile development project time may be worth as much as several hundred thousand dollars per day For this reason decisions must be evaluated for their impact on development time as well as for their impact on manufacturing cost While saving 1 in cost on each manifold would be worth perhaps 1 million in annual cost savings it would almost certainly not be worth causing a delay in an automobile program The relationship between and development time is complex Here we note a few aspects of the relationship The application of some of the guidelines may result in very complex parts These parts may be so complex that their design or the procurement of their tooling becomes the activity that determines the duration of the overall development effort Ulrich et 1993 The cost benefits of the decision may not be worth the delay in project duration This is particularly true for products competing in dynamic markets The Impact of on Development Cost Development cost closely mirrors development time Therefore the same caution about the relationship between part complexity and development time applies to Design for Manufacturing 273 cost In general however teams that aggressively pursue low manufacturing costs as an integral part of the development process seem to be able to develop products in about the same time and with about the same budget as teams that do not Part of this phenomenon certainly arises from the correlation between good project management practices and the application of sound methods The Impact of on Product Quality Before proceeding with a decision the team should evaluate the impact of the decision on product quality Under ideal circumstances actions to decrease manufacturing cost would also improve product quality For example the new GM manifold resulted in cost reduction weight reduction and improved engine performance It is not uncommon for efforts focused primarily on manufacturing cost reduction to also result in improved serviceability ease of disassembly and recycling However in some cases actions to decrease manufacturing cost can have adverse effects on product quality such as reliability or robustness so it is advisable for the team to keep in mind the many dimensions of quality that are important for the product The Impact of on External Factors Design decisions may have implications beyond the responsibilities of a single development team In economic terms these implications may be viewed as Two such externalities are component reuse and life cycle costs Component reuse Taking time and money to create a low cost component may be of value to other teams designing similar products In general this value is not explicitly accounted for in manufacturing cost estimates The team may choose to take an action that is actually more costly for their product because of the positive cost implications for other projects Life cycle costs Throughout their life cycles certain products may incur some company or societal costs that are not or are rarely accounted for in the manufacturing cost For example products may contain toxic materials requiring special handling in disposal Products may incur service and warranty costs Although these costs may not appear in the manufacturing cost analysis they should be considered before adopting a decision Chapter 12 Design for Environment provides a detailed method of addressing life cycle costs During the design for manufacturing practices were put into place in thousands of firms Today is an essential part of almost every product development effort No longer can designers throw the design over the wall to production engineers As a result of this emphasis on improved design quality some manufacturers claim to have reduced production costs of products by up to 50 percent In fact comparing current new product designs with earlier generations one can usually identify fewer parts in the new product as well as new materials more integrated and custom parts higher volume standard parts and and simpler assembly procedures A sketch of the redesigned intake manifold is shown in Exhibit 13 15 This fort achieved

improvements over the previous design include Unit cost savings of 45 percent Mass savings of 66 percent 3 3 kilograms Simplified assembly and service procedures Improved emissions performance due to routing of into the manifold Improved engine performance due to reduced air induction temperatures Reduced shipping costs due to lighter components Increased standardization across vehicle programs For this product the manufacturing cost savings alone amount to several million annually The other benefits listed above are also significant although somewhat more difficult to quantify Summary Design for manufacturing is aimed at reducing manufacturing costs while simultaneously improving or at least not inappropriately compromising product quality development time and development cost begins with the concept development phase and system level design phase in these phases important decisions must be made with the manufacturing cost implications in mind utilizes estimates of manufacturing cost to guide and prioritize cost reduction efforts Cost estimation requires expertise with the relevant production processes Suppliers and manufacturing experts must be involved in this process Since accurate cost estimation is very difficult much of practice involves making informed decisions in the absence of detailed cost data Component costs are reduced by understanding what drives these costs Solutions may involve novel component design concepts or the incremental improvement of existing designs through simplification and standardization Assembly costs can be reduced by following well established design for assembly guidelines Components can be redesigned to simplify assembly operations or components can be eliminated entirely by integration of their functions into other components Reduction of manufacturing support costs begins with an understanding of the drivers of complexity in the production process Design decisions have a large impact on the costs of supporting production Choices should be made with these effects in mind even though overhead cost estimates are often insensitive to such changes is an integrative method taking place throughout the development process and requiring inputs from across the development team decisions can affect product development lead time product development cost and product quality Trade offs will frequently be necessary between manufacturing cost and these equally important broader issues 276 Chapter 13 References and Bibliography Many current resources are available on the Internet via u rich net Two

required to prepare the equipment for a production run Setup costs are charged for each run Tooling costs are incurred in advance of the first production run and tooling can usually be reused for later production runs However in very high volume production runs tooling wears out and therefore is a recurring expense Tooling costs may be spread over the entire production volume or may be charged separately programming time is generally also a one time expense like a tooling cost Material types are listed for each part Material weights and costs include processing scrap and waste Processing costs vary with the type of manufacturing equipment used and include charges for both machine time and labor While fixed costs setup and tooling are sometimes billed separately from material and processing costs for these examples fixed costs are spread over the production volume shown Unit costs are calculated as costs costs p g costs Total unit cost Volume The cost rates given include overhead charges so these data are representative of custom components purchased from suppliers Description of Processes machining includes computer controlled milling and turning processes machines are highly flexible due to automatic tool changing mechanisms multiple work axes and programmable computer control To produce a particular part a machinist must first program the cutting tool trajectories and tool selections into the machine s computer Also fixtures or other tooling may be utilized to produce multiple parts more efficiently Once the program is written and fixtures are made subsequent production runs can be set up much more quickly Injection molding is the process of forcing hot plastic under high pressure into a mold where it cools and solidifies When the part is sufficiently cool the mold is opened the part is ejected the mold closes and the cycle begins again Mold complexity depends highly on the part geometry undercuts features that would prevent the part from ejecting out of the mold are achieved using mold actions or retracting pins Progressive die stamping is the process of passing a sheet or strip of metal through a set of dies to cut and or form it to a desired size and shape While some stampings require only cutting formed stampings are made by bending and stretching the metal beyond its yield point thereby causing permanent deformation Sand castings are created by forming a sand mold from master patterns tooling in the shape of the final part Special binders are mixed with the sand to allow the sand to retain shape when packed around the pattern to create a single use mold Internal cavities in a casting can be created using additional sand cores inside the outer mold Molten for Manufacturing 285 is then poured into the mold where the metal cools and solidifies Once cool the sand is broken off to reveal the metal casting Sand castings generally require subsequent machining operations to create finished components Investment castings are made by first creating a temporary wax pattern using master tooling The wax pattern is then dipped or immersed in plaster or ceramic slurry which is allowed to solidify The form is then heated melting out the wax and leaving behind only the thin shell as a mold Molten metal is then poured into the mold where it cools and solidifies When the metal is cool the mold is broken off to reveal the metal part Detailed process descriptions for the above and numerous other processes as well as more detailed cost estimating techniques can be found in the reference books listed for this

enforcement and military personnel to conduct operations in dangerous environments For example robots were used to help search for survivors in the wreckage of the World Trade Center in September 2001 They have assisted military operations around the world and they are used by police for bomb retrieval and disposal The mobile chassis of the accepts a wide range of payloads including a robotic arm

dropped off a fire truck into a wide range of challenging and unpredictable situations In developing the the product development team at utilized various forms of prototypes throughout the product development process Prototypes not only helped develop a successful product quickly but also helped ensure the reliability of the in the field This chapter defines prototype explains why prototypes are built and then presents several principles of prototyping practice The chapter also describes a method for planning prototypes before they are built The is used as an illustrative example throughout Prototyping 291 Understanding Prototypes Although dictionaries define prototype as a noun only in product development practice the word is used as a noun a verb and an adjective For example 0 Industrial designers produce prototypes of their concepts 0 Engineers prototype a design Software developers write prototype programs We define prototype as an approximation of the product along one or more dimensions of interest Under this definition any entity exhibiting at least one aspect of the product that is of interest to the development team can be viewed as a prototype This definition deviates from standard usage in that it includes such diverse forms of prototypes as concept sketches mathematical models simulations test components and fully functional preproduction versions of the product Prototyping is the process of developing such an approximation of the product Types of Prototypes Prototypes can be usefully classified along two dimensions The first dimension is the degree to which a prototype is physical as opposed to analytical Physical prototypes are tangible artifacts created to approximate the product Aspects of the product of interest to the development team are actually built into an artifact for testing and experimentation Examples of physical prototypes include models that look and feel like the product proof of concept prototypes used to test an idea quickly and experimental hardware used to validate the functionality of a product Exhibit 14 3 shows three forms of physical prototypes used for diverse purposes Analytical prototypes represent the product in a usually mathematical or visual manner Interesting aspects of the product are analyzed rather than built Examples of analytical prototypes include computer simulations systems of equations encoded within a spreadsheet and computer models of three dimensional geometry Exhibit 14 4 shows three forms of analytical prototypes used for diverse purposes The second dimension is the degree to which a prototype is comprehensive as opposed to focused Comprehensive prototypes implement most if not all of the attributes of a product A comprehensive prototype corresponds closely to the everyday use of the word prototype in that it is a full scale fully operational version of the product An example of a comprehensive prototype is one given to customers in order to identify any remaining design flaws before committing to production In contrast to comprehensive prototypes focused prototypes implement one or a few of the attributes of a product Examples of focused prototypes include foam models to explore the form of a product and hand built circuit boards to investigate the electronic performance of a product design A common practice is to use two or more focused prototypes together to investigate the overall performance of a product One of these prototypes is often a looks like prototype and the other is a works like prototype By building two separate focused prototypes the team may be able to answer its questions much earlier than if it had to create one integrated comprehensive prototype Exhibit 14 5 displays a plot with axes corresponding to these two dimensions Several different prototypes from the example are shown on this plot Note that Chapter 14 EXHIBIT 1 4 3 Examples of physical prototypes in the project a Looks like model for customer communication and

customer proposal b finite element analysis of Wheel spoke geometry c dynamic simulation model Courtesy of Corp b Prototyping 293294 Chapter 14 prototypes can be either physical or analytical but that for tangible manufactured products fully comprehensive prototypes must generally be physical Prototypes sometimes contain a combination of analytical and physical elements For example control hardware including the user interface for the could be linked to a software simulation of the dynamic motion Some analytical prototypes can be viewed as being more physical than others For example a video animation of the s dynamic balance based on simulation of the physical interactions of its components is in one sense more physical than a set of equations approximating the overall balance of the same mechanism What Are Prototypes Used For Within a product development project prototypes are used for four purposes learning communication integration and milestones Learning Prototypes are often used to answer two types of questions Will it work and How well does it meet the customer needs When used to answer such questions prototypes serve as learning tools In developing the wheels for the the team built focused physical prototypes of the novel spiral spoke geometry of the wheels The wheels were mounted to a weighted platform and dropped at various heights to test the shock absorption properties and the strength of the wheels Exhibit 14 6 shows several of the wheel prototypes and one of the impact tests Also in development of the wheel design mathematical models of the spokes were analyzed to estimate the stiffness and strength of the wheels This is an example of a focused analytical prototype used as a learning tool Physical Alpha Prototype for A System Integration 0 Wheel O O

of prototypes Prototypes can be classified according to the degree to which they are physical and the degree to which they implement all of the attributes of the product Prototyping 295 Courtesy of Corp EXHIBIT 14 6 wheel prototypes top and impact testing bottom Communication Prototypes enrich communication with top management vendors partners extended team members customers and investors This is particularly true of physical prototypes a visual tactile three dimensional representation of a product is much easier to understand than a verbal description or even a sketch of the product When developing new payload capabilities for the communication among engineers managers suppliers and customers is enhanced through the use of look and feel prototypes New customers often fail to appreciate the small size of the crush zone into which the payload must fit however a physical model clearly illustrates this space constraint The rough physical prototype shown in Exhibit 3 a was used to communicate to early customers the physical size of the and the range of mobility of its camera support arm This model was constructed from components using rapid prototyping technology assembled and painted to represent the actual size and appearance of the product Integration Prototypes are used to ensure that components and subsystems of the product work together as expected Comprehensive physical prototypes are most effective as integration tools in product development projects because they require the assembly and physical interconnection of all the parts and that make up a product In doing so Chapter 14 prototype forces coordination between different members of the product development team If the combination of any of the components of the product interferes with the overall function of the product the problem may be detected through physical integration in a comprehensive prototype Common names for these comprehensive physical prototypes are testbed alpha beta or preproduction prototypes Two such prototypes of the are shown in Exhibit 14 7 In the alpha prototype the radios are visible in the center of the robot In the beta prototype the radios were integrated into the body for protection from damage Extensive testing of the alpha prototype helped identify several improvements to the track system which was redesigned before the beta prototype was built Further testing of the beta prototype included a wide range of field conditions such as mud sand and water testing Prototypes also help integrate the perspectives of the different functions represented on a product development team Leonard Barton 1991 A simple physical model of the form of a product can be used as the medium through which the marketing design and manufacturing functions agree on a basic design decision Many software development processes use prototypes to integrate the activities of dozens of software developers Microsoft for example employs a daily build in which a new version of the product is compiled at the end of every day Software developers check in their code by a fixed time of day e g 5 00 pm and a team compiles the code to create a new prototype version of the software The most recent version of the software is then tested and used by everyone on the team in a practice Microsoft calls eating your own dog food This practice of creating daily comprehensive prototypes ensures that the efforts of the developers are always synchronized and integrated Any conflicts are detected immediately and the team can never diverge more than one day from a working version of the product 1997 Milestones Particularly in the later stages of product development prototypes are used to demonstrate that the product has achieved a desired level of functionality Milestone prototypes provide tangible goals demonstrate progress and serve to enforce the schedule Senior management and sometimes the customer often requires a prototype that demonstrates certain functions before allowing the project to proceed For example in many government procurements a prototype must pass a qualification test and later Courtesy of Corp EXHIBIT 1 4 7

Appropriateness of different types of prototypes for different purposes 0 more appropriate 0 less appropriate Note that fully comprehensive analytical prototypes are rarely possible for physical products a first article test before a contractor can proceed with production A major milestone for the development was a test conducted by the US Army During this test the prototype was thrown out of a moving vehicle and controlled by a soldier with minimal training in an unknown environment There could be no failures of the system and its user interface in order to pass this test While all types of prototypes are used for all four of these purposes some types of prototypes are more appropriate than others for some purposes A summary of the relative appropriateness of different types of prototypes for different purposes is shown in Exhibit 14 8 Principles of Prototyping Several principles are useful in guiding decisions about prototypes during product development These principles inform decisions about what type of prototype to build and about how to incorporate prototypes into the development project plan Analytical Prototypes Are Generally More Flexible Than Physical Prototypes Because an analytical prototype is a mathematical approximation of the product it will generally contain parameters that can be varied in order to represent a range of design alternatives In most cases changing a parameter in an analytical prototype is easier than changing an attribute of a physical prototype For example consider an analytical prototype of the that includes a set of equations representing the electric motor One of the parameters in the mathematical model of the motor is the stall torque Varying this parameter and then solving the equations is much easier than changing an actual motor in a physical prototype In most cases the analytical prototype not only is easier to change than a physical prototype but also allows larger changes than could be made in a physical prototype For this reason an analytical prototype frequently precedes a physical prototype The analytical prototype is used to narrow the range of feasible parameters and then the physical prototype is used to fine tune or confirm the design See Chapter 15 Robust Design for a detailed example of the use of an analytical prototype to explore several design parameters Physical Prototypes Are Required to Detect Unanticipated Phenomena A physical prototype often exhibits unanticipated phenomena completely unrelated to the original objective of the prototype One reason for these surprises is that all Chapter 14 the laws of physics are operating when the team experiments with physical prototypes Physical prototypes intended to investigate purely geometric issues will also have thermal and optical properties Some of the incidental properties of physical prototypes are irrelevant to the final product and act as annoyances during testing However some of these incidental properties of physical prototypes will also manifest themselves in the final product In these cases a physical prototype can serve as a tool for detecting unanticipated detrimental phenomena that may arise in the final product For example in a pull test of various gripper finger coatings the team discovered that some of the coatings with good grip characteristics had poor durability Analytical prototypes in contrast can never reveal phenomena that are not part of the underlying analytical model on which the prototype is based For this reason at least one physical prototype is almost always built in a product development effort A Prototype May Reduce the Risk of Costly Iterations Exhibit 14 9 illustrates the role of risk and iteration in product development In many situations the outcome of a test may dictate whether a development task will have to be Probability of success 0 70 Build Injection Mold Probability of iteration 0 30 Conventional Process Probability Probability of success of success 0 70 0 95 Build Prototype Part Build Injection Mold Probability Probability of iteration of iteration 0 30 0 05 Process with Prototyping EXHIBIT 1 4 9 A prototype may reduce the risk of costly iteration Taking time to build and test a prototype may allow the development team to detect a problem that would otherwise not have been detected until after a costly development activity such as building an injection mold Prototyping 299 repeated For example if a molded part fits poorly with its mating parts the mold tooling may have to be rebuilt In Exhibit 14 9 a 30 percent risk of returning to the mold building activity after testing part fit is represented with an arrow labeled with a probability of 0 30 If building and testing a prototype substantially increases the likelihood that the subsequent activities will proceed without iteration e g from 70 percent to 95 percent as indicated in Exhibit 14 9 the prototype phase may be justified The anticipated benefits of a prototype in reducing risk must be weighed against the time and money required to build and evaluate the prototype This is particularly important for comprehensive prototypes Products that are high in risk or uncertainty because of the high costs of failure new technology or the revolutionary nature of the product will benefit from such prototypes On the other hand products for which failure costs are low and the technology is well known do not derive as much benefit from prototyping Most products fall between these extremes Exhibit 14 10 represents the range of situations that can be encountered in different types of development projects A M h Analytical prototypes used any extensively prototypes L 5 Carefully planned prototypes Examples Sometimes the first unit built x software consumer products is actually sold 0 5 Examples 3 airplanes satellites automobiles 6 E h 0 Ta 2 C 5 One prototype may be Few or no 2 built for verification prototypes built 3 3 Examples Examples printed goods commercial buildings ships Low High Cost of Comprehensive Prototype Time or Money EXHIBIT 1 4 1 0 The use of comprehensive prototypes depends on the relative level of technical or market risk and the cost of building a comprehensive prototype 300 Chapter 14 Conventional Process Part Design Mold Design Mold Fabrication Part Design Prototype Mold Design Mold Fabrication I Process with Prototyping Time EXHIBIT 1 4 1 1 Role of a prototype in expediting another step Taking time to build a prototype may enable more rapid completion of a subsequent step A Prototype May Expedite Other Development Steps Sometimes the addition of a short prototyping phase may allow a subsequent activity to be completed more quickly than if the prototype were not built If the required additional time for the prototype phase is less than the savings in duration of the subsequent activity then this strategy is appropriate One of the most common occurrences of this situation is in mold design as illustrated in Exhibit 14 11 The existence of a physical model of a geometrically complex part allows the mold designer to more quickly visualize and design the mold tooling Conventional Process

Test EXHIBIT 1 4 1 2 Use of a prototype to remove a task from the critical path Prototyping 301 A Prototype May Restructure Task Dependencies The top part of Exhibit 14 12 illustrates a set of tasks that are completed sequentially It may be possible to complete some of the tasks concurrently by building a prototype For example a software test may depend on the existence of a physical circuit Rather than waiting for the production version of the printed circuit board to use in the test the team may be able to rapidly fabricate a prototype e g a hand built board and use it for the test while the production of the printed circuit board proceeds Prototyping Technologies Hundreds of different production technologies are used to create prototypes particularly physical prototypes Two technologies have emerged as particularly important in the past 20 years three dimensional computer modeling CAD and free form fabrication CAD Modeling and Analysis Since the the dominant mode of representing designs has shifted dramatically from drawings often created using a computer to computer aided design models known as CAD models CAD models represent designs as collections of solid entities each usually constructed from geometric primitives such as cylinders blocks and holes The advantages of CAD modeling include the ability to easily visualize the three dimensional form of the design the ability to create photo realistic images for assessment of product appearance the ability to automatically compute physical properties such as mass and volume and the efficiency arising from the creation of one and only one canonical description of the design from which other more focused descriptions such as cross sectional views and fabrication drawings can be created Through the use of computer aided engineering tools CAD models have begun to serve as analytical prototypes In some settings this can eliminate one or more physical prototypes When CAD models are used to carefully plan the final integrated assembly of the product and to detect geometric interference among parts this may indeed eliminate the need for a full scale prototype For example in the development of the Boeing 777 and 787 jets the development teams were able to avoid building full scale wooden prototype models of the planes which had historically been used to detect geometric interferences among structural elements and the components of various other systems such as hydraulic lines Using a CAD model of an entire product in this manner is known depending on the industry setting as a digital mock up digital prototype or virtual prototype CAD models are also the underlying representation for many types of analyses Forms of include finite element analysis of thermal flow or stress distribution virtual crash testing of automobiles kinematic and dynamic motion of complex mechanisms all of which have become more sophisticated every year In the development engineers conducted finite element analysis of structural integrity to understand impact stresses at various drop and crash angles Exhibit 14 13 shows one such analytical result based on a CAD model of the Engineers also computed heat flows and thermal dissipation performance using finite element analysis based on CAD models 302 Chapter 14 Courtesy of Corp EXHIBIT 1 4 1 3 Finite element analysis of the side plate based on a CAD model The image shows the stress distribution upon side impact at the rear wheel Free Form Fabrication In 1984 the first commercial free form fabrication system was introduced by Systems This technology called and dozens of competing technologies that followed it create physical objects directly from CAD models and can be thought of as three dimensional printing This collection of technologies is often called rapid prototyping Most of the technologies work by constructing an object one cross sectional layer at a time by depositing a material or by using a laser to selectively solidify a liquid or powder The resulting parts are most often made from plastics but other materials are available including wax paper ceramics and metals In some cases the parts are used directly for visualization or in working prototypes However the parts are often used as patterns to make molds or patterns from which parts with particular material properties can then be molded or cast Free form fabrication technologies enable realistic prototypes to be created earlier and less expensively than was possible before When used appropriately these prototypes can reduce product development time and or improve the resulting product quality In addition to enabling the rapid construction of working prototypes these technologies can be used to embody product concepts quickly and inexpensively increasing the ease with which concepts can be communicated to other team members senior managers development partners or potential customers For example the prototype shown in Exhibit 3 a was made of components fabricated using in only four days Prototyping 303 Planning for Prototypes A potential pitfall in product development is what called the hardware swamp 1994 The swamp is caused by misguided prototyping efforts that is the building and debugging of prototypes physical or analytical that do not substantially contribute to the goals of the overall product development project One way to avoid the swamp is to carefully define each prototype before embarking on an effort to build and test it This section presents a four step method for planning each prototype during a product development project The method applies to all types of prototypes focused comprehensive physical and analytical A template for recording the information generated from the method is given in Exhibit 14 14 We use the wheel prototype and impact test shown in Exhibit 14 6 as an example to illustrate the method Step 1 Define the Purpose of the Prototype Recall the four purposes of prototypes learning communication integration and milestones In defining the purpose of a prototype the team lists its specific learning and communication needs Team members also list any integration needs and whether or not the prototype is intended to be one of the major milestones of the overall product development project For the wheel prototypes the purpose was to determine the shock absorption characteristics and robustness of the wheels using various geometry and materials While these learning prototypes were primarily focused on performance the team was also considering the manufacturing cost of the materials some of which were not and must be machined Name of Prototype Wheel Geometry Impact Test Purpose s 0 Select final wheel spoke geometry and materials based on strength and shock absorption characteristics 0 Confirm that wheels absorb shock to withstand impact and protect the and its payload Level of Approximation 0 Correct wheel spoke geometry materials and platform load Experimental Plan 0 Build 12 test wheels using six different materials each with two spoke shapes 0 Mount the wheels to the test fixture 0 Conduct impact tests at a range of drop heights Schedule I August select wheel designs and materials 7 August complete design of test fixture 14 August wheels and test fixture constructed 15 August assembly completed 23 August testing completed 25 August analysis of test results completed Courtesy of Corp EXHIBIT 1 4 1 4 Planning template for the wheel geometry impact test prototypes 304 Chapter 14 Step 2 Establish the Level of Approximation of the Prototype Planning a prototype requires definition of the degree to which the final product is to be approximated The team should consider whether a physical prototype is necessary or whether an analytical prototype would best meet its needs In most cases the best prototype is the simplest prototype that will serve the purposes established in step 1 In some cases an earlier model serves as a testbed and may be modified for the purposes of the prototype In other cases an existing prototype or a prototype being built for another purpose can be utilized For the wheel prototype the team decided that materials and geometry of the wheel were critical attributes related to impact performance so the prototype needed to be constructed carefully with these attributes in mind However other aspects of the wheel could be ignored including the production method molding versus machining the attachment to the drive system and the track belt and the color and overall appearance of the wheel A member of the team had previously explored an analytical model of the wheel spoke bending performance and felt that the physical prototype was necessary to verify her analysis She had discovered that there was a basic trade off between shock absorption which required more flexible spokes and strength of the wheel which required larger spokes The team used the analytical prototype to determine the wheel spoke dimensions that would be investigated with the physical prototype Step 3 Outline an Experimental Plan In most cases the use of a prototype in product development can be thought of as an experiment Good experimental practice helps ensure the extraction of maximum value from the prototyping effort The experimental plan includes the identification of the variables of the experiment if any the test protocol an indication of what measurements will be performed and a plan for analyzing the resulting data When many variables must be explored efficient experiment design greatly facilitates this process Chapter 15 Robust Design discusses design of experiments in detail For the wheel prototype tests the team decided to vary only the materials and web geometry of the spokes Based on the analytical models two spoke shapes were selected for testing Six different materials were also chosen for a total of 12 test designs The team designed a weighted platform to which each wheel could be mounted and a test apparatus for dropping the platform at various heights They decided to instrument the platform to measure the acceleration forces transmitted through the wheels to the upon impact After each test they inspected the wheel for damage in the form of cracks or plastic deformation before increasing the test height These test results would not only be used to choose the best spoke geometry and material but also to improve the analytical model for future use which may eliminate further physical prototyping of modified wheel designs Step 4 Create a Schedule for Procurement Construction and Testing Because the building and testing of a prototype can be considered a within the overall development project the team benefits from a schedule for the prototyping activity Three dates are particularly important in defining a prototyping effort First the team defines when the parts will be ready to assemble This is sometimes called the bucket of parts date Second the team defines the date when the prototype will first be tested Prototyping 305 This is sometimes called the smoke test date because it is the date the team will first apply power and look for smoke in products with electrical systems Third the team defines the date when it expects to have completed testing and produced the final results For the wheel prototypes no assembly was involved so when parts were available the prototypes could be assembled and tested rather quickly The team planned for eight days of testing and two days of analysis Planning Milestone Prototypes The above method for planning a prototype applies to all prototypes including those as simple as the wheel geometry and those as complex as the beta prototype of the entire Nevertheless the comprehensive prototypes a team uses as development milestones benefit from additional planning This planning activity typically occurs in conjunction with the overall product development planning activity at the end of the concept development phase In fact planning the milestone dates is an integral part of establishing an overall product development project plan See Chapter 18 Managing Projects All other things being equal the team would prefer to build as few milestone prototypes as possible because designing building and testing comprehensive prototypes consumes a great deal of time and money However in reality few highly engineered products are developed with fewer than two milestone prototypes and many efforts require four or more As a base case the team should consider using alpha beta and preproduction prototypes as milestones The team should then consider whether any of these milestones can be eliminated or whether in fact additional prototypes are necessary Alpha prototypes are typically used to assess whether the product works as intended The parts in alpha prototypes are usually similar in material and geometry to the parts that will be used in the production version of the product but they are usually made with prototype production processes For example plastic parts in an alpha prototype may be machined or rubber molded instead of injection molded as they would be in production Beta prototypes are typically used to assess reliability and to identify remaining bugs in the product These prototypes are often given to customers for testing in the intended use environment The parts in beta prototypes are usually made with actual production processes or supplied by the intended component suppliers but the product is usually not assembled with the intended final assembly facility or tooling For example the plastic parts in a beta prototype might be molded with the production injection molds but would probably be assembled by a technician in a prototype shop rather than by production workers or automated equipment Preproduction prototypes are the first products produced by the entire production process At this point the production process is not yet operating at full capacity but is making limited quantities of the product These prototypes are used to verify production process capability are subjected to further testing and are often supplied to preferred customers Preproduction prototypes are sometimes called pilot production prototypes The most common deviations from the standard prototyping plan are to eliminate one of the standard prototypes or to add additional early prototypes Eliminating a prototype usually the alpha may be possible if the product is very similar to other Chapter 14 the firm has already developed and produced or if the product is extremely simple Additional early prototypes are common in situations where the product embodies a new concept or technology These early prototypes are sometimes called experimental or engineering prototypes They usually do not look like the final product and many of the parts of the prototype are not designed with the intention of eventually being produced in quantity Once preliminary decisions have been made about the number of prototypes their characteristics and the time required to assemble and test them the team can place these milestones on the overall time line of the project When the team attempts to schedule these milestones the feasibility of the overall product development schedule can be assessed Frequently a team will discover when working backward from the target date for the product launch that the assembly and test of one milestone prototype overlaps or is perilously close to the design and fabrication of the next milestone prototype If this overlapping happens in practice it is the worst manifestation of the hardware swamp When prototyping phases overlap there is little transfer of learning from one prototype to the next and the team should consider omitting one or more of the prototypes to allow the remaining prototypes to be spread out more in time During project planning overlapping prototyping phases can be avoided by beginning the project sooner delaying product launch eliminating a milestone prototype or devising a way to accelerate the development activities preceding each prototype See Chapter 18 Managing Projects for some techniques for achieving this acceleration Summary Product development almost always requires the building and testing of prototypes A prototype is an approximation of the product on one or more dimensions of interest Prototypes can be usefully classified along two dimensions 1 the degree to which they are physical as opposed to analytical and 2 the degree to which they are comprehensive as opposed to focused Prototypes are used for learning communication integration and milestones While all types of prototypes can be used for all of these purposes physical

used for physical products as well What might be the costs and benefits of such an approach for physical products CHAPTER FIFTEEN Robust Design Courtesy of Ford Motor Co EXHIBIT 15 1 Rear seat belt experiment This experiment was run on a simulation model to explore many design parameters and noise conditions 311312 Chapter 15 Ford Motor Company safety engineers were working with a supplier to better understand the performance of rear seat belts In any conventional seat belt system with lap and shoulder belts if the lap portion of the belt rides upward the passenger may slide beneath it potentially resulting in abdominal injury This phenomenon called submarining is related to a large number of factors including the nature of the collision the design of the vehicle the properties of the seats and seat belts and other conditions Based on experimentation simulation and analysis Ford engineers hoped to determine which of the many factors were most critical to passenger safety and to avoiding submarining The image shown in Exhibit 15 1 depicts the model used in Ford s simulation analysis This chapter presents a method for designing and conducting experiments to improve the performance of products even in the presence of uncontrollable variations This method is known as robust design What Is Robust Design We define a robust product or process as one that performs as intended even under conditions such as manufacturing process variations or a range of operating situations We use the term noise to describe uncontrolled variations that may affect performance and we say that a quality product should be robust to noise factors Robust design is the product development activity of improving the desired performance of the product while minimizing the effects of noise In robust design we use experiments and data analysis to identify robust for the design parameters we can control A robust is a combination of design parameter values for which the product performance is as desired under a range of operating conditions and manufacturing variations Conceptually robust design is simple to understand For a given performance target safely restraining rear seat passengers for example there may be many combinations of parameter values that will yield the desired result However some of these combinations are more sensitive to uncontrollable variation than others Because the product will likely operate in the presence of various noise factors we would like to choose the combination of parameter values that is least sensitive to uncontrollable variation The robust design process uses an experimental approach to finding these robust To understand the concept of robust consider two hypothetical factors affecting some measure of seat belt performance as shown in Exhibit 15 2 that factor A has a linear effect on performance and factor B has a nonlinear effect Further consider that we can choose for each factor or for factor A and or for factor B Assuming that the effects of and are additive a combination of and will provide approximately the same level of overall performance as a combination of and Manufacturing variations will be present at any chosen so that the actual value may not be exactly as specified By choosing the value of for factor B where the sensitivity of the response to factor B is relatively small unintended variation in factor B has a relatively small influence on overall product performance Therefore the choice of and is a more robust combination of than the combination of and Al The robust design process can be used at several stages of the product development process As with most product development issues the earlier that robustness can be considered in the product development process the better the robustness results can be Robust Design 31 3 Response to Response to Factor A Factor B p III I I Bl EXHIBIT 1 5 2 Robust design exploits nonlinear relationships to identify where the product performance is less sensitive to variations In this example the chosen value for the factor A does not affect robustness whereas that of factor B does Choosing Bl minimizes the effect of variation in factor B on overall performance Robust design experiments can be used within the concept development phase as a way to refine the specifications and set realistic performance targets While it is beneficial to consider product robustness as early as the concept stage experiments for robust design are used most frequently during the detail design phase as a way to ensure the desired product performance under a variety of conditions In detail design the robust design activity is also known as parameter design as this is a matter of choosing the right for the design parameters under our control These include the product s materials dimensions tolerances manufacturing processes and operating instructions For many engineering design problems equations based on fundamental physical principles can be solved for robust parameter choices However engineers generally cannot fully model the kinds of uncertainties variations and noise factors that arise under real conditions Furthermore the ability to develop accurate mathematical models is limited for many engineering problems For example consider the difficulty of accurately modeling the seat belt submarining problem under a wide variety of conditions In such situations empirical investigation through designed experiments is necessary Such experiments can be used to directly support decision making and can also be used to improve the accuracy of mathematical models In the case of the seat belt design problem Ford s engineers wished to test a range of seat belt design parameters and collision conditions However crash testing is very expensive so Ford worked with its seat belt supplier to develop a simulation model which was calibrated using experimental crash data Considering the hundreds of possible design parameter combinations collision conditions and other factors of interest the engineers chose to explore the simulation model using a carefully planned experiment Although simulation requires a great deal of computational effort the simulation model still allowed Ford engineers to run dozens of experiments under a wide variety of conditions which would not have been possible using physical crash testing 314 Chapter 15 For the Ford seat belt design team the goals of this designed experiment were to learn What combination of seat seat belt and attachment parameters minimizes rear seat passenger submarining during a crash 0 How submarining is affected by uncontrollable conditions What combination of design parameters is most robust to such noise factors Design of Experiments The approach to robust design presented in this chapter is based on a method called design of experiments DOE In this method the team identifies the parameters that can be controlled and the noise factors it wishes to investigate The team then designs conducts and analyzes experiments to help determine the parameter to achieve robust performance In Japan during the and Dr developed techniques to apply DOE to improve the quality of products and manufacturing processes Beginning with the quality movement of the s approach to experimental design started to have an impact on engineering practice in the United States particularly at Ford Motor Company Xerox Corporation AT T Bell Laboratories and through the American Supplier Institute which was created by Ford receives credit for promoting several key ideas of experimental design for the development of robust products and processes These contributions include introducing noise factors into experiments to observe these effects and the use of a Signal to noise ratio metric including both the desired performance signal and the undesired effects noise While statisticians had been showing engineers how to run experiments for decades it was not until s methods were widely explained to the US manufacturing industry during the that experiments became commonly utilized to achieve robust design DOE is not a substitute for technical knowledge of the system under investigation In fact the team should use its understanding of the product and how it operates to choose the right parameters to investigate by experiment The experimental results can be used in conjunction with technical knowledge of the system in order to make the best choices of parameter Furthermore the experimental results can be used to build better mathematical models of the product s function In this way experimentation complements technical knowledge For example Ford engineers have basic mathematical models of seat belt performance as a function of passenger sizes and collision types These models allow Ford to size the mechanical elements and to determine the belt attachment geometry Based on empirical and simulation data Ford s analytical models and seat belt design guidelines gain precision over time reducing the need for time consuming empirical and simulation studies Eventually this technical knowledge may improve to the point where only confirming tests of new seat belt configurations are required Basic experimental design and analysis for product development can be successfully planned and executed by the development team However the field of DOE has many advanced methods to address a number of complicating factors and yield more useful experimental results Development teams thus can benefit from consulting with a statistician or DOE expert who can assist in designing the experiment and choosing the best analytical approach Robust Design 31 5 The Robust Design Process To develop a robust product through DOE we suggest this seven step process Identify control factors noise factors and performance metrics Formulate an objective function Develop the experimental plan Run the experiment Conduct the analysis Select and confirm factor Reflect and repeat Step 1 Identify Control Factors Noise Factors and Performance Metrics The robust design procedure begins with identification of three lists control factors noise factors and performance metrics for the experiment Control factors These are the design variables to be varied in a controlled manner during the experiment in order to explore the product s performance under the many combinations of parameter Experiments are generally run at two or three discrete levels values of each factor These parameters are called control factors because they are among the variables that can be specified for production and or operation of the product For example the webbing stiffness and coefficient of friction are control factors of interest for the experiment Noise factors Noise factors are variables that cannot be explicitly controlled during the manufacturing and operation of the product Noise factors may include manufacturing variances changes in materials properties multiple user scenarios or operating conditions and even deterioration or misuse of the product If through special techniques the team can control the noise factors during the experiment but not in production or operation then variance can deliberately be induced during the experiment to assess its impact Otherwise the team simply lets the noise take place during the experiment analyzes the results in the presence of typical variation and seeks to minimize the effects of this variation For seat belts to be used with a range of seats the shape of the seat and the seat fabric must be considered noise factors The goal is to design a seat belt system that works well regardless of the values of these factors Performance metrics These are the product specifications of interest in the experiment Usually the experiment is analyzed with one or two key product specifications as the performance metrics in order to find control factor to optimize this performance These metrics may be derived directly from key specifications where robustness is of critical concern See Chapter 6 Product Specifications For example how far the passenger s back or buttocks move forward during the collision would be possible performance metrics for the seat belt experiment For the seat belt design problem the team held a meeting to list the control factors noise factors and performance metrics As teaches they placed these lists into a single graphic called a parameter diagram or p diagram as shown in Exhibit 15 3 316 Chapter 15 EXHIBIT 1 5 3 Parameter diagram used to design the seat belt experiment Bold text indicates the performance metric used and the control factors and noise factors chosen for exploration Control Factors Passenger Performance Metrics Restraint Belt webbing stiffness Process Back angle Belt webbing friction Slip of buttocks Lap belt force limiter Hip rotation Forward knee motion Noise Factors Shape of rear seat Type of seat fabric Severity of collision Wear of components Positioning of passenger Positioning of belts on body Size of passenger Type of clothing fabric Web manufacturing variations Latch manufacturing variations Upper anchorage stiffness Buckle cable stiffness Front bolster Tongue friction Attachment geometry After listing the various factors the team must decide which ones will be explored by experiment When a large number of parameters are suspected of potentially affecting performance the selection of critical variables can be substantially narrowed by using analytical models and or by running a screening experiment with two levels for each of many factors Then a finer experiment is run with two or more levels of the few parameters believed to affect performance Ford engineers considered the lists shown in Exhibit 15 3 They chose to focus the experiment on exploration of seven seat belt parameters holding constant the geometric locations of the three attachment points They decided to use back angle at peak as the output metric the angle that the passenger s back makes with respect to vertical at the moment of maximum restraint Back angle is a smaller is better performance metric measured in radians A primary concern in this experiment was the effect of three particular noise factors seat shape fabric type and severity of collision Through preliminary analysis the team found the best and worst combinations of these noise conditions with respect to the submarining effect These three noise factors were thereby combined into two extreme noise conditions for the purposes of the experiment This approach known as compounded noise can be helpful when many noise factors must be considered See Testing Noise Factors in step 3 Step 2 Formulate an Objective Function The experiment s performance metric s must be transformed into an objective function that relates to the desired robust performance Several objective functions are useful in robust design for different types of performance concerns They can be formulated either as functions to be maximized or minimized and they include 0 Maximizing This type of function is used for performance dimensions where larger values are better such as maximum deceleration before belt slippage Common forms of this objective function n are n u or n p where u is the mean of the experimental observations under a given test condition Robust Design 31 7 Minimizing This type of function is used for performance dimensions where smaller values are better such as back angle at peak deceleration Common forms of this objective function are n p or r 02 where 02 is the variance of the experimental observations under a given test condition Alternatively such minimization objectives can be formulated as functions to be maximized such as T 1 u or n 1 02 Target value This type of function is used for performance dimensions where values closest to a desired or target are best such as amount of belt slackening before restraint A common maximizing form of this objective function is T l p t 2 where t is the target value Signal to noise ratio This type of function is used particularly to measure robustness formulates this metric as a ratio with the desired response in the numerator and the variance in the response as the denominator Generally the mean value of the desired response such as the mean back angle at peak is not difficult to adjust by changing control factors In the denominator we place the variance of this response the noise response which is to be minimized such as the variance in back angle resulting from noise conditions In practice reducing variance is more difficult than changing the mean By computing this ratio we can highlight robust factor settings for which the noise response is relatively low as compared to the signal response A common maximizing form of this objective function is n 10 log pf 02 The Ford statistician consulting with the team suggested two objective functions the average back angle at peak and the range of the back angle at peak the difference between the maximum and minimum back angle at peak at the two noise conditions to be tested Both of these are objectives to be minimized Together these two metrics would provide deeper insight into the behavior of the system than either one alone Step 3 Develop the Experimental Plan Statisticians have developed many types of efficient experimental plans These plans lay out how to vary the factor levels values of the control factors and possibly also some of the noise factors in a series of experiments in order to explore the system s behavior Some DOE plans are more efficient for characterizing certain types of systems while others provide more complete analysis Experimental Designs A critical concern in designing experiments is the cost of setting up and running the experimental trials In situations where this cost is low running a large number of trials and using an experimental design with resolution high enough to explore more factors factor combinations and interactions may be feasible On the other hand when the cost of experimentation is high efficient DOE plans can be used that simultaneously change several factors at once Some of the most popular experimental designs are listed below and depicted in Exhibit 15 4 Each one has important uses F all factorial This design involves the systematic exploration of every combination of levels of each factor This allows the team to identify all of the Chapter 15 Full Factorial Matrix 1 2 Fractional Factorial Matrix x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x

plans for seven factors A B C D E F and G at two levels each The full factorial experiment contains 27 128 trials While the orthogonal array design contains only 8 trials denoted by the X marks in the matrices The orthogonal array plan is the one used for the seat belt experiment and is shown in conventional row column format in Exhibit 15 5 Robust Design 31 9 effects in addition to the primary main effect of each factor on performance This type of experiment is generally practical only for a small number of factors and levels and when experiments are inexpensive as with fast software based simulations or very flexible hardware For an investigation of k factors at n levels each the number of trials in the full factorial experiment is Full factorial experimentation is typically infeasible for an experiment with greater than four to five factors Fractional factorial This design uses only a small fraction of the combinations used above In exchange for this efficiency the ability to compute the magnitudes of all the interaction effects is sacrificed Instead the interactions are confounded with other interactions or with some of the main factor effects Note that the fractional factorial layout still maintains balance within the experimental plan This means that for the several trials at any given factor level each of the other factors is tested at every level the same number of times Orthogonal array This design is the smallest fractional factorial plan that still allows the team to identify the main effects of each factor However these main effects are confounded with many interaction effects Nevertheless orthogonal array layouts are widely utilized in technical investigations because they are extremely efficient popularized the orthogonal array DOE approach even though statisticians had developed such plans several decades earlier and the roots of these designs can be traced back many centuries Orthogonal array plans are named according to the number of rows experiments in the array and so on The appendix to this chapter shows several orthogonal array experimental plans One factor at a time This is an unbalanced experimental plan because each trial is conducted with all but one of the factors at nominal levels and the first trial having all the factors at the nominal level This is generally considered to be an ineffective way to explore the factor space even though the number of trials is small 1 k n 1 However for parameter optimization in systems with significant interactions an adaptive version of the one at a time experimental plan has been shown to be generally more efficient than orthogonal array plans Frey et 2003 The Ford team chose to use the orthogonal array experiment design because this plan would be an efficient way to explore seven factors at two levels each Subsequent rounds of experimentation could later be used to explore additional levels of key parameters as well as interaction effects if necessary The orthogonal array experimental plan is shown in Exhibit 15 5 Testing Noise Factors Several methods are used to explore the effects of noise factors in experiments If some noise factors can be controlled for the purpose of the experiment then it may be possible to directly assess the effect of these noise factors If the noise factors cannot be controlled during the experiment we allow the noise to vary naturally and simply assess the product s performance in the presence of noise Some common ways to test noise factors are 0 Assign additional columns in the orthogonal array or fractional factorial layout to the noise factors essentially treating the noise as another variable This allows the effects of the noise factors to be determined along with the control factors 320

combinations of the noise factors for each row in the main inner array An example of this approach is shown in the appendix where the outer array consists of an design testing combinations of three noise factors by replicating each row four times Run replicates of each row allowing the noise to vary in a natural uncontrolled manner throughout the experiment resulting in measurable variance in performance for each row With this approach it is particularly important to randomize the order of the trials so that any trends in the noise are unlikely to be correlated with the systematic changes in the control factors See step 4 Run replicates of each row with compounded noise In this method selected noise factors are combined to create several representative noise conditions or extreme noise conditions This approach also yields measurable variance for each row which can be attributed to the effect of noise The Ford team chose to utilize the compounded noise approach in the seat belt experiment The team tested each row using the two combinations of the three noise factors representing the best and worst case conditions This resulted in 16 experimental runs for the DOE plan as shown in Exhibit 15 5 Robust Design 321 A B C D E F G N N Avg Range 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 3403 0 2915 0 3159 0 0488 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 0 4608 0 3984 0 4296 0 0624 3 1 2 2 1 1 2 2 0 3682 0 3627 0 3655 0 0055

by each row in the experimental plan Randomizing the sequence of the experimental runs ensures that any systematic trend over the duration of the experiment is not correlated with the systematic changes to the levels of the factors For example if the experiments of the plan are not randomized and the test conditions drift over time this effect may be incorrectly attributed to factor A because this column changes halfway through the experiment For some experiments changing certain factors may be so difficult that all trials at each level of that factor are run together and only partial randomization may be achieved In practice randomize the trials whenever practical and when not possible validate the results with a confirmation run See step 6 In the seat belt experiment each of the eight factor combinations in the design was tested under the two compounded noise conditions The 16 data points containing the back angle data are shown in Exhibit 15 6 in the columns titled N and N Step 5 Conduct the Analysis There are many ways to analyze the experimental data For all but the most basic analysis the team benefits from consulting with a DOE expert or from referring to a good book on statistical analysis and experimental design The basic analytical method is summarized here Computing the Objective Function The team will have already devised the objective functions for the experiment and will generally have an objective related to the mean performance and the variance in performance Sometimes the mean and variance will be combined and expressed as a single objective in the form of a signal to noise ratio The values of the objective function can be computed for each row of the experiment For the seat belt experiment the on the right side of the table in Exhibit 15 6 show the computed objective function values average back angle and range of back angle for each row Recall that these are both objectives to be minimized 322 Chapter 15 EXHIBIT 1 5 7 Factor effects charts for the seat belt experiment Computing Factor Effects by Analysis of Means The most straightforward analysis to conduct will simply yield the main effect of each factor assigned to a column in the experiment These main effects are called the factor The analysis of means involves simply averaging all the computed objective functions for each factor level In the DOE example the effect of factor level Al at level 1 is the average of trials 1 2 3 and 4 Similarly the effect of factor level is the average of trials 2 4 5 and 7 The results of an analysis of means are conventionally shown on factor effects charts Exhibit 15 7 presents the factor effects charts for the seat belt example These effects are plotted for each of the objective functions Exhibit 15 7 a plots the average performance at each factor level the first objective function This chart shows which factor levels can be used to raise or lower the mean performance Recall that back angle at peak is to be minimized

necessarily achieve robust performance Exhibit 15 7 b is based on the range of performance at each factor level the second objective function This chart suggests that levels will minimize the range of back angle at peak recommends that the signal to noise ratio for each factor level be plotted in order to identify robust Because the signal to noise ratio includes the mean performance in the numerator and the variance in the denominator it represents a combination of these two objectives or a trade off between them Rather than specifically plotting the signal ratio many engineers and statisticians prefer to simply interpret the two objectives together giving more control over the trade off To do so the factor effects charts shown in Exhibit 15 7 can be compared in order to choose a robust in the next step Step 6 Select and Confirm Factor Analysis of means and the factor effects charts help the team determine which factors have a strong effect on mean performance and variance and therefore how to achieve robust performance These charts help to identify which factors are best able to reduce the product s variance robustness factors and which factors can be used to improve the performance scaling factors By choosing based on these insights the team should be able to improve the overall robustness of the product For example consider the effects of factor A on both average and range of back angle in the experiment The charts in Exhibit 15 7 show that level would minimize back angle but level would minimize the range of back angle representing a trade off between performance and robustness A similar trade off is evident in factor F However for factors B C D E and G there is no such trade off and levels and minimize both objectives Using factors B C D E and G to achieve the desired robustness and factors A and F to increase performance Ford engineers selected the As is usually the case the chosen is not one of the eight orthogonal array rows tested in the experiment Given that this has never been tested a confirmation run should be used to ensure that the expected robust performance has been achieved Step 7 Reflect and Repeat One round of experiments may be sufficient to identify appropriately robust Sometimes however further optimization of the product s performance is worthwhile and this may require several additional rounds of experimentation In subsequent experimentation and testing the team may choose to 0 Reconsider the chosen for factors displaying a trade off of performance versus robustness 0 Explore interactions among some of the factors in order to further improve the performance 0 Fine tune the parameter using values between the levels tested or outside this range 324 Chapter 15 Caveats Investigate other noise and or control factors that were not included in the initial experiment As with all product development activities the team should take some time to reflect on the DOE process and the robust design result Did we run the right experiments Did we achieve an acceptable result Could it be better Should we repeat the process and seek further performance robustness improvement Design of experiments is a well established field of expertise This chapter summarizes only one very basic approach in order to encourage the use of experimentation in product design to achieve more robust product performance Most product development teams should include team members with DOE training or have access to engineers and or statisticians with specialized expertise in design and analysis of experiments Obviously many assumptions underlie the type of analysis used in DOE One basic assumption made in interpreting analysis of means is that the factor effects are independent without interactions across the factors In fact most actual systems exhibit many interactions but these interactions are often smaller than the main effects Verification of this assumption is another motive for running confirming experiments at the chosen If necessary experiments can be designed to specifically test interaction effects This type of experiment is outside the scope of this chapter DOE texts generally provide a number of ways to explore interactions across the factors including the following 0 Assign specific interactions to be explored in certain columns of the orthogonal array instead of using the column for a control factor 0 Execute a larger fractional factorial design Use an adaptive one at a time experimental plan Frey et 2003 Many advanced graphical and analytical techniques are available to assist in interpretation of the experimental data Analysis of variance provides a way to assess the significance of the factor effects results in light of the experimental error observed in the data takes into account the number of observations made of each degree of freedom in the experiment and the scale of the results to determine whether each effect is statistically significant This helps determine to what extent detailed design decisions should be based on the experimental results However makes many more assumptions and can be difficult to set up properly so it is also beyond the scope of this chapter Refer to a DOE text Ross 1996 Montgomery 2007 or consult with a DOE expert to assist with Summary Robust design is a set of engineering design methods used to create robust products and processes A robust product or process is one that performs properly even in the presence of noise effects Noises are due to many kinds of uncontrolled variation that may Design 325 performance such as manufacturing variations operating conditions and product deterioration We suggest an approach to the development of robust products based on design of experiments DOE This seven step process for robust design is Identify control factors noise factors and performance metrics Formulate an objective function Develop the experimental plan Run the experiment Conduct the analysis Select and confirm factor Reflect and repeat Orthogonal array experimental plans provide a very efficient method for exploring the main effects of each factor chosen for the experiment To achieve robust performance use of objective functions helps in capturing both mean performance due to each control factor and variance of performance due to noise factors 0 Analysis of means and factor effects charts facilitate the choice of robust parameter Because many nuances are involved in successful DOE most teams applying these methods will benefit from assistance by a DOE expert References and Bibliography Many current

two level and three level factor experiments Using advanced techniques DOE plans can also be created for mixed two three and or four level factor experiments and many other special situations This appendix shows some of the basic orthogonal arrays from s text Introduction to Quality Engineering 1986 These plans are shown in row column format with the factor level assignments in the columns and the experimental runs in the rows The numbers 1 2 and 3 in each cell indicate the factor levels Alternatively factor levels can be labeled as and for two level factors or 0 and for three levels Recall that the orthogonal arrays are named according to the number of rows in the design Included here are the two level arrays and and the arrays and Also shown is a DOE plan using the inner array for

by David W Coffin Sr US Patent 5 205 473 331332 Chapter 16 David Coffin an individual inventor developed a product concept and prototype for an insulating sleeve that would make a hot beverage cup more comfortable to hold Exhibit 16 1 The product opportunity arose in the after many food vendors had abandoned polystyrene foam hot beverage cups in favor of paper cups The inventor was interested in commercialization and or licensing his invention and sought protection of the intellectual property that he had created This chapter provides an overview of intellectual property in the context of product development and provides specific guidance for preparing an invention disclosure or provisional patent application Within the context of product development the term intellectual property refers to the legally ideas concepts names designs and processes associated with a new product Intellectual property can be one of the most valuable assets of firms Unlike physical property intellectual property cannot be secured with lock and key to prevent its unwanted transfer Therefore legal mechanisms have been developed to protect the rights of intellectual property owners These mechanisms are intended to provide an incentive and reward to those who create new useful inventions while at the same time encouraging the dissemination of information for the long run benefit of society What Is Intellectual Property Four types of intellectual property are relevant to product design and development Exhibit 16 2 presents a taxonomy of types of intellectual property Although some areas overlap and all four types of intellectual property may be present in a single product a particular invention usually falls into one of these categories Patent A patent is a temporary monopoly granted by a government to an inventor to exclude others from using an invention In the United States a patent expires 20 years from the filing date Most of the balance of this chapter focuses on patents Trademark A trademark is an exclusive right granted by a government to a trademark owner to use a specific name or symbol in association with a class of products or services In the context of product development trademarks are typically brands or product names For example is a trademark for an insulated cup holder and companies other than Java Jacket Inc may not make unauthorized use of the word to refer to their own cup holder products In the United States registration of a trademark is possible but not strictly necessary to preserve the trademark rights In most other countries the rights of a trademark are gained through registration Trade secret A trade secret is information used in a trade or business that offers its owner a competitive advantage and that can be kept secret A trade secret is not a right conferred by a government but is the result of vigilance on the part of an organization in preventing the dissemination of its proprietary information Perhaps the most famous trade secret is the formula for the beverage Coca Cola Copyright A copyright is an exclusive right granted by a government to copy and distribute an original work of expression whether literature graphics music art entertainment or software Registration of a copyright is possible but not necessary A copyright comes into being upon the first tangible expression of the work and lasts for up to 95 years Patents and Intellectual Property 333 Intellectual Property Patents Utility Design Plant Trade Patents Patents Patents Trademarks Copyright Secret Product Design 1 Development Fig 10 1 Useful Ornamental New Word or Original Proprietary 2 Novel Design Only Plant Symbol Work of and Useful 3 Expression may be registered but requires formal application not necessary not registered EXHIBIT 1 6 2 Taxonomy of types of intellectual property relevant to product design and development This chapter focuses on patents Appendix A to this chapter briefly discusses trademarks We do not devote substantial attention here to copyrights and trade secrets but several references to other resources appear at the end of the chapter Overview of Patents For most engineered goods two basic types of patents are relevant design patents and utility patents A third type of patent covers plants Design patents provide the legal right to exclude someone from producing and selling a product with the identical ornamental design described by the design patent A design patent can be thought of as a copyright for the ornamental design of a product Because design patents must be limited to ornamental design for most engineered goods design patents are of very limited value For this reason the chapter focuses further on utility patents Patent law in most of the world evolved from English law and so patent laws in different countries are somewhat similar This chapter uses US law as a reference point and so readers with intentions to obtain patents in other countries should carefully investigate the laws in those countries 334 Chapter 16 Utility Patents United States law allows for patenting of an invention that relates to a new process machine article of manufacture composition of matter or a new and useful improvement of one of these things Fortunately these categories include almost all inventions embodied by new products Note that inventions embodied in software are sometimes patented but usually the invention is described as a process or machine Exhibit 16 3 shows the first page of a patent for the insulating sleeve invented by Coffin In addition the law requires that patented inventions be Useful The patented invention must be useful to someone in some context Novel Novel inventions are those that are not known publicly and therefore are not evident in existing products publications or prior patents The definition of novelty relates to disclosures of the actual invention to be patented as well In the United States an invention to be patented must not have been revealed to the public more than a year before the patent is filed Patent law defines obvious inventions as those that would be clearly evident to those with ordinary skill in the art who faced the same problem as the inventor Usefulness is rarely a hurdle to obtaining a patent However the requirements that an invention be novel and are the most common barriers to obtaining a patent About two thirds of applications filed for patents result in issued patents However an issued patent is not necessarily valid A patent may be challenged in a government court by a competitor at some point in the future The validity of a patent is determined by among other factors the adequacy of the description in the patent and the novelty of the invention relative to the prior art A tiny fraction of patents a few hundred per year in the United States are ever challenged in court Of those challenged in recent years just over half have been found to be valid An inventor associated with a patent is a person who actually created the invention individually or in collaboration with other inventors In some cases the inventor is also the owner of the intellectual property However in most cases the patent is assigned to some other entity usually the inventors employer The actual intellectual property rights associated with a patent belong to the owner of the patent and not necessarily to the inventor Appendix B to this chapter provides some advice to individual inventors interested in commercializing their inventions A patent owner has the right to exclude others from using making selling or importing an infringing product This is an right which requires that the patent owner sue the infringer There are also defensive rights associated with patents Any invention described in a patent whether part of the claimed invention or not is considered by the legal system to be known publicly and forms part of the prior art This disclosure is a defensive act blocking a competitor from patenting the disclosed invention Preparing a Disclosure This chapter is focused on a process for preparing an invention disclosure in essence a detailed description of an invention This disclosure will be in the form of a patent application which can serve as a provisional patent application and with relatively little additional work could be a regular patent application It is possible even typical for a and Intellectual Property 335 United States Patent 19 11 Patent Number 5 205 473 Coffin Sr 45 Date of Patent Apr 27 1993 54 RECYCLABLE

which employ recyclable materials but provide fluting structures for containing insulating air These products are easy to hold and have a lesser impact on the environment than polystyrene containers 57 18 Claims 8 Drawing Chapter 16 attorney to do much of the work described in the chapter However our belief is that having the inventor draft a detailed disclosure is the best way to communicate the inventor s knowledge even though in most cases a patent attorney will revise the disclosure to prepare the formal patent application Although many readers will be able to complete a provisional patent application from the guidance provided here this chapter is not a substitute for competent legal advice Inventors pursuing serious commercial opportunities should consult with a patent attorney after preparing their disclosure The steps in the process are Formulate a strategy and plan Study prior inventions Outline claims Write the description of the invention Refine claims Pursue application Reflect on the results and the process Step 1 Formulate a Strategy and Plan In formulating a patent strategy and plan a product development team must decide on the timing of the filing of a patent application the type of application to be filed and the scope of the application Timing of Patent Applications Legally a U S patent application must be filed within one year of the first public disclosure of an invention In much of the rest of the world a patent must be filed before any public disclosure or within one year of filing a U S application so long as the U S application is filed before public disclosure In most cases public disclosure is a description of the invention to an individual or group of people who are not obligated to keep the invention confidential Examples of such disclosure include publication of invention details in a magazine or journal presentation of a product at a trade show display of the invention on a publicly accessible Web site or test marketing of a product Most experts agree that a student s class presentation of an invention is not public disclosure as long as the class members have agreed to preserve the confidentiality of the invention and as long as members of the general public are not present We strongly recommend that inventors file patent applications before any public disclosure This action ensures that the option to file an international patent is preserved for one year Fortunately a provisional patent application may be filed at relatively little expense to preserve these rights Although we recommend that filing precede public disclosure the inventor usually benefits by delaying the application until just before such disclosure The principal advantage to waiting as long as possible is that the inventor has as much knowledge as possible about the invention and its commercialization Very often what the inventor believes are the key features of an invention early in the innovation process turn out to be less important than refinements developed later in the innovation process By waiting the inventor can ensure that the most important elements of the invention are captured in the patent application Patents and Intellectual Property 337 The US patent system grants priority among competing patent applications based on the date of invention whereas the patent systems in much of the rest of the world grant priority based on the date of the patent application Therefore in the United States inventors should carefully document the date of their inventions This is best done by describing an invention in a bound notebook and then having a witness sign and date each page Type of Application A team faces two basic choices about the type of patent application to be pursued First the team must decide whether to file a regular patent application or a provisional patent application Second the team must decide whether to pursue domestic and or foreign patents A regular patent application was the only option available to an inventor in the United States until substantial changes were made to patent law in 1995 Under current US patent law an inventor may file a provisional patent application A provisional patent application needs only to fully describe the invention It does not need to contain claims or comply with the formal structure and language of a regular patent application The principal advantage of a provisional patent application is that it requires less cost and effort to prepare and file than a regular patent application but it preserves all options to pursue further patent filings for a period of one year Once a provisional patent application has been filed a company may label its products patent pending and it retains the right to file a foreign patent application and or a regular patent application The only fundamental disadvantage of a provisional patent application is that it delays the eventual issuance of a patent by up to one year as the process of examining a patent application does not begin until a regular patent application is filed Another possible disadvantage is that the preliminary nature of a provisional patent application may lead to the use of less care in preparing the description of the invention than might be the case with a regular application The description of the invention must be complete in a provisional patent application and the regular patent application that follows cannot contain features that were not described in the provisional application Filing patents internationally is expensive and somewhat complex The team should therefore consult with a patent professional about international patent strategy as patent law varies somewhat from country to country To obtain foreign patent rights an application must eventually be filed in each country in which a patent is sought The European Community however acts as a single entity with respect to patent filing Foreign applications can be expensive costing up to 15 000 per country for filing fees translation fees and patent agent fees The expense of filing for foreign patents can be delayed generally by 30 months by filing a Patent Cooperation Treaty PCT application A PCT application is filed in one country e g the United States but is designated as a PCT application which is the beginning of a process by which foreign patents can be pursued A PCT application costs only slightly more than a regular patent application in filing fees but it allows for a substantial delay before application fees must be paid in the countries in which foreign patents are sought The provisional patent application and the PCT application together provide a vehicle for a small company or individual inventor to preserve most patent rights with relatively little cost A typical strategy is to file a provisional patent application before any public disclosure of the invention then within one year to file a PCT application with the US patent office then when forced to act or abandon the application at some point in Chapter 16 future usually a year or more away to pursue actual foreign applications This strategy allows a delay of two or more years before substantial legal and application fees must be paid During this period the team can assess the true commercial potential of the products embodying the invention and can estimate the value of more extensive patent protection Scope of Application The team should evaluate the overall product design and decide which elements embody inventions that are likely to be patentable Typically the process of reviewing the product design will result in a list of elements that the team considers to be novel and The team should focus on those elements that present substantial barriers to competition which are typically the elements that in the opinion of the team represent a substantial improvement over the publicly known methods of addressing similar problems Complex products often embody several inventions For example a printer may embody novel signal processing methods and novel paper handling techniques Sometimes these inventions fall into very different classes within the patent system As a result a product development team may need to file multiple applications corresponding to the distinct classes of invention For simple products or for products that embody a single type of invention a single patent application usually suffices The decision about whether to divide an application into multiple parts is complex and is best made in consultation with a patent attorney However all intellectual property rights are preserved even if a patent application is filed that contains multiple classes of inventions In such cases the patent office will inform the inventor that the application must be divided While defining the scope of the patent the team should also consider who the inventors are An inventor is a person who contributed substantially to the creation of the invention The definition of an inventor for the purposes of patent law is subjective For example a technician who only ran experiments would not typically be an inventor but a technician who ran experiments and then devised a solution to an observed problem with the device could be considered an inventor There is no limit to the number of inventors named in a patent application We believe that product development and invention are most often team efforts and that many members of the team who participated in concept generation and the subsequent design activities could be considered inventors Failing to name a person who is an inventor can result in a patent being declared not valid Step 2 Study Prior Inventions There are three key reasons for studying prior inventions the so called prior art First by studying the prior patent literature design teams can learn whether an invention may infringe on existing unexpired patents Although there is no legal barrier to patenting an invention that infringes on an existing patent if anyone manufactures sells or uses a product that infringes upon an existing patent without a license the patent owner may sue for damages Second by studying the prior art the inventors get a sense of how similar their invention is to prior inventions and therefore how likely they are to be granted a broad patent Third the team will develop background knowledge enabling the members to craft novel claims In the course of product development efforts most teams accumulate a variety of references to prior inventions Some of the sources of information on prior inventions include Patents and Intellectual Property 339 0 Existing and historical product literature 0 Patent searches 0 Technical and trade publications Several good reference sources can be used for searching patents Simple keyword searches are often sufficient to find most relevant patents It is important for the team to keep a file containing the prior art they are aware of This information must be provided to the patent office shortly after filing the patent application In the Coffin patent for the cup holder shown in Exhibit 16 1 references to 19 other US patents are cited along with a reference to a book The references cited by the inventor and by the patent examiner are listed on the first page of a patent The first page of the Coffin patent is reproduced as Exhibit 16 3 Among the prior art for the Coffin patent for example is a 1930 patent by Benson 1 771 765 Waterproof Paper Receptacle in which a corrugated holder insulates a paper liner cup The Benson patent describes a cup holder that fits underneath and into the bottom of the liner cup This is one reason that the invention in the Coffin patent is described as a tube with an opening at the top and bottom Step 3 Outline Claims Issuance of a patent gives the owner a legal right to exclude others from infringing on the invention specifically described in the patent s claims Claims describe certain characteristics of the invention they are written in formal legal language and must adhere to some rules of composition In step 5 we describe how the formal legal language works However at this point in the process of preparing the disclosure the team benefits from thinking carefully about what it believes is unique about the invention We therefore recommend that the team outline the claims Don t worry about legal precision at this point Instead make a list of the features and characteristics of the invention that the team believes are unique and valuable For example an outline of the claims for the Coffin invention might be Use of corrugations as insulation in many possible forms Corrugations on the inside surface of the tube Corrugations on the outside surface of the tube Corrugations sandwiched between two flat layers of sheet material Vertical orientation of flutes Flutes open at top and bottom of holder Corrugations with triangle wave cross section Corrugations with sine wave cross section 0 Tubular form with openings at both ends 0 In shape of truncated cone Recyclable materials 0 Recyclable adhesive Recyclable sheeting Cellulose Chapter 16 Biodegradable adhesive Surface to print on 0 Holder folds flat along two fold lines The outline of the claims provides guidance about what must be described in detail in the description Step 4 Write the Description of the Invention The bulk of a patent application is formally known as the Specification To avoid confusion with our use of the word Specifications in this book we call the body of the patent application the description because this is the part of the application that actually describes the invention The description must present the invention in enough detail that someone with ordinary skill in the art i e someone with the skills and capabilities of a typical practitioner working in the same basic field as the invention could implement the invention The description should also be a marketing document promoting the value of the invention and the weaknesses in existing solutions The patent application will be read by a patent examiner who will search and study prior patents The description must convince the examiner that the inventors developed something useful that is different from existing inventions and that is In these respects one can think of the description as essentially a technical report on the invention There are some formatting conventions for patent applications although these are not strictly necessary for an invention disclosure or a provisional patent application Patent law requires that the application teach with sufficient detail that someone skilled in the art could practice the invention For example in the Coffin patent the inventor discloses that the adhesive to bond the flutes is a recyclable and preferably a biodegradable adhesive for example adhesive by Inc Grand Rapids MI The requirement to completely teach the invention may be somewhat counterintuitive for someone accustomed to treating inventions confidentially Patent law requires that inventors disclose what they know about the invention but in exchange they are granted the right to exclude others from practicing the invention for a limited time period This requirement reflects the basic tension in the patent system between granting a temporary monopoly to inventors in exchange for publication of information that will eventually be available for use by anyone A typical description includes the following elements Title Provide a short descriptive label for the invention for example Recyclable Corrugated Beverage Container and Holder List of inventors All inventors must be listed A person should be listed as an inventor if he or she originated any of the inventions claimed in the application There are no legal limits to the number of inventors and no requirements about the order in which inventors are listed A failure to list an inventor could result in a patent eventually being declared not valid Field of the invention Explain what type of device product machine or method this invention relates to For example the Coffin patent reads This invention relates to insulating containers and especially to those which are recyclable and made of materials Patents and Intellectual Property 341 Background of the invention State the problem that the invention solves Explain the context for the problem what is wrong with existing solutions why a new solution is needed and what advantages are offered by the invention Summary of the invention This section should present the substance of the invention in summarized form The summary may point out the advantages of the invention and how it solves the problems described in the background Brief description of the drawings List the figures in the description along with a brief description of each drawing For example Figure 10 is a perspective view of a preferred embodiment illustrating internal flute portions in breakaway views Detailed description of the invention This section of the description is usually the most comprehensive and contains detailed descriptions of embodiments of the invention along with an explanation of how these embodiments work Further discussion of the detailed description is provided below Figures Formal figures for patents must comply with a variety of rules about labeling line weight and types of graphical elements However for an invention disclosure or provisional patent application informal figures are sufficient and hand sketches or CAD drawings are perfectly appropriate At some point after filing a regular patent application the patent office will request formal figures at which time a professional drafter may be hired to prepare formal versions of the necessary figures Prepare enough figures to clearly show the key elements of the invention in the preferred embodiments that have been considered A simple invention like the cup holder would probably require 5 to 15 figures The features shown in the figures may be labeled with words e g outer layer although to facilitate preparation of a regular patent application the team may wish to use reference numerals on the figures right from the beginning No rule stipulates that reference numerals must be uninterrupted and consecutive so a convenient numbering scheme uses reference numerals 10 11 12 and so on for features that first appear in Figure 1 reference numerals 20 21 22 and so on for features that first appear in Figure 2 and so on This way adding numerals to one figure does not influence the use of numerals in another figure The same feature shown in more than one figure must be labeled with the same reference numeral so some numerals will be carried over from one figure to another Writing the Detailed Description The detailed description describes embodiments of the invention An embodiment is a physical realization of the claimed invention Patent law requires that the application describe the preferred embodiment that is the best way of practicing the invention Typically a detailed description is organized as a collection of paragraphs each describing an embodiment of the invention in terms of its physical structure along with an explanation of how that embodiment works A good strategy for writing the detailed description is to first create the figures that show embodiments of the invention Next describe the embodiment by labeling each feature of the embodiment in the figure and explaining the arrangement of these features Finally explain how the embodiment works and why the features are important to this function This process is repeated for each of the embodiments described in the detailed description 342 Chapter 16 EXHIBIT 1 6 4 Figure 10 from the Coffin patent FIG 10 Consider Figure 10 from the Coffin patent shown here as Exhibit 16 4 A detailed description might include language like the following A preferred embodiment of the invention is shown in Figure 10 A liner surface 22 and an outer surface 24 sandwich a corrugation 21 The assembly 200 forms a tubular shape whose diameter changes linearly with length so as to form a section of a truncated cone The smooth outer surface 24 provides a smooth surface onto which graphics may be printed Corrugation 21 is bonded to outer surface 24 and liner surface 22 with a recyclable adhesive The detailed description should show alternative embodiments of the invention For example in the Coffin patent the invention features flutes that create an insulating air gap In a preferred embodiment these flutes are formed by smooth wavy corrugations with the smooth surface on the outside to allow for graphics to be easily printed on the sleeve Alternative embodiments include triangle waves and or sheet materials on either or both sides of the tube These alternative embodiments are described in the detailed description and shown in the figures See Exhibit 16 5 Defensive Disclosure The primary benefit of a patent is that it grants the owner Offensive rights That is the owner has the right to prevent others from practicing the invention However patents also offer a subtle mechanism for taking defensive actions A patent is considered prior art and so an invention that appears in a patent may not be patented in the future For this reason 1 6 5 Figures and from the Coffin patent showing alternative embodiments of the invention Patents and Intellectual Property 343 11 24 21 12 22 Fig Fig 31 44 41 32 42 Fig Fig may benefit from disclosing essentially every invention they considered that relates to the claimed invention no matter how wide ranging This may be done in the detailed description Even though these inventions may not actually be reflected in the claims of the patent their disclosure becomes part of the prior art and therefore prevents others from patenting them This defensive strategy may offer competitive advantages in fields of emerging technologies Step 5 Refine Claims The claims are a set of numbered phrases that precisely define the essential elements of the invention The claims are the basis for all offensive patent rights A patent owner can prevent others from practicing the invention described by the claims only The rest of the patent application is essentially background and context for the claims Writing the Claims Although claims must be expressed verbally they adhere to a strict mathematical logic Almost all claims are formulated as a recursive expression of the form X A B C u v w 3 This is expressed verbally as comprising an A a B and a C wherein said A is comprised of a u a v and a w and wherein said B is Note that claims comply with some verbal conventions The word comprising means including but not limited to and is almost always used as the equal sign in the expression The first time an element say a liner sheet is named in a claim the inventor uses the indefinite article a as in comprises a liner sheet Once this element has been named it is never referred to as the liner sheet but always as said liner sheet This is true for every subsequent instance in which liner sheet is used in the claims Although these conventions Chapter 16 not difficult to remember once learned inventors preparing a disclosure for subsequent editing by a patent attorney should not worry too much about formal correctness of the language The language is easily corrected when the formal patent application is prepared Multiple claims are arranged hierarchically into independent claims and dependent claims Independent claims stand alone and form the root nodes of a hierarchy of claims Dependent claims always add further restrictions to an independent claim Dependent claims are typically written in this form The invention of Claim N comprising Q R and S or The invention of Claim N wherein said A Dependent claims essentially inherit all of the properties of the independent claim on which they depend In fact a dependent claim can be read as if all of the language of the independent claim on which it depends were inserted as a replacement for the introductory phrase The invention of Claim N The dependent claims are important in that the patent office may reject the independent claim as obvious or not novel while allowing one or more dependent claims In such cases patentable material remains the original independent claim can be deleted and the original dependent claim can be rewritten as an independent claim The elements of a claim form a logical and relationship To infringe on a claim a device must include each and every element named in the claim If for example a competitive product were to use only three of four elements named in a claim it would not infringe on the claim Consider this example from the Coffin patent edited slightly for clarity Claim 1 A beverage container holder comprising a corrugated tubular member comprising material and at least a first opening therein for receiving and retaining a beverage container said corrugated tubular member comprising fluting means for containing insulating air said fluting means comprising fluting adhesively attached to a liner with a recyclable adhesive Claim 1 is an independent claim Consider Claim 2 which is dependent on Claim 1 Claim 2 The holder of claim 1 wherein said tubular member further comprises a second opening wherein said first opening and said second opening are of unequal cross sectional dimensions This claim adheres to the logical structure shown in Exhibit 16 6 Let us reinforce the idea that a claim is formed of a logical and relation among its elements Claim 1 is for a holder that includes all of these elements Corrugated tube Made of material 0 With a first opening 0 With fluting means Made of flutes adhesively attached to a liner Using recyclable 16 6 The logical structure of Claims 1 and 2 from the Coffin patent Note that Claim 2 is dependent on Claim 1 and simply adds further restrictions a second opening and a relationship between the first and second openings Patents and Intellectual Property 345 Claim 1 material fluting means liner flutes l recyclable adhesive If a competing cup holder does not have every one of these elements it does not infringe upon this claim So for example if it were made of polystyrene it would not infringe on this claim no material Consider a patent by Jay Sorensen filed shortly after the Coffin patent Sorensen s patent is for a cup holder with a dimpled surface See Exhibit 16 7 Because this invention does not have fluting means it does not infringe upon the Coffin patent Sorensen s claims include the following edited slightly for clarity Claim 4 A cup holder comprising a band of material formed with an open top and an open bottom through which a cup can extend and an inner surface immediately adjacent to said cup said band comprising a plurality of discrete spaced apart approximately semi spherically shaped depressions distributed on substantially the entire inner surface of said band so that each depression defines a non contacting region of said band creating an air gap between said band and said cup thereby reducing the rate of heat transfer through said holder At least two lessons can be derived from comparing the Coffin and Sorensen inventions First patents often provide relatively limited commercial advantages In this case by creating a cup holder with dimples instead of flutes Sorensen was able to avoid infringing on the Coffin patent In fact both inventions are embodied by successful commercial products but neither patent provides ironclad protection from competition The second lesson is that the inventor should invest in considering as many ways as possible to achieve the desired function of the invention in this case an insulating layer Had Coffin thought of a dimpled surface then this feature could have been described in his patent application In the best case the dimpled invention may have formed the basis for additional claims in the patent In the worst case the description of the dimpled embodiment in the patent application would have been prior art and therefore prevented Sorensen from obtaining his patent It would not prevent Sorensen and others from practicing the dimpled invention unless it were claimed 346 Chapter 16 EXHIBIT 1 6 7 Figure from the Sorensen patent US Patent 5 425 497 dimpled cup holder Guidelines for Crafting Claims Several guidelines are helpful in crafting claims Writing great claims is tricky so we advise inventors to seek the help of an experienced patent attorney in refining a patent application 0 Always try to make a claim as general as possible When a specific descriptor is used try making it general For example Coffin s patent speaks of a tubular member and not a tube 99 6 Avoid absolute definitions by using modifiers like substantially essentially and approximately 0 Attempt to create an invention that does not infringe on the draft claim and then try to rewrite the claim or add an additional claim such that the hypothetical invention would infringe Step 6 Pursue Application In most cases the inventor will deliver the draft application to a patent attorney or other intellectual property professional for refinement and formal application It is possible to file a patent application as an individual if severely budget constrained Pressman provides detailed guidelines for doing this Pressman 2008 Note that the statutory requirements are administratively complex and so we highly recommend that and Intellectual Property 347 product development teams retain a competent specialist to pursue any application to the patent office Once an invention disclosure is prepared the team can proceed in four different ways with the specific course of action dictated by the business context The team can file a provisional patent application An individual or small company can file a provisional patent application for less than 100 in filing fees The application need contain only a description of the invention and need not comply with the formalities of a regular patent application Once a provisional application is filed a product may be labeled patent pending If the team wishes to pursue a regular patent application this application must be filed within one year of the filing of the provisional patent application A provisional patent therefore acts as an option to pursue a regular patent application and allows the team time to pursue licensing or further investigation before incurring the expense of a regular patent application The team may file a regular patent application in the United States This process costs about 500 in filing fees for a small company or individual in addition to the legal fees for a patent attorney The team may file a patent cooperation treaty or PCT application A PCT application allows a single patent application in a single country say the United States to initiate the process of pursuing international patent protection Eventually the inventor must pursue patent protection in individual countries or collections of countries e g European Union However the PCT process allows the first steps of the process to be carried out relatively efficiently and with a single point of contact The entire process of pursuing foreign patent rights is beyond the scope of this chapter Consult a patent attorney for details The team can defer application indefinitely The team may delay in hope that future information will make a course of action obvious In some cases the team may decide not to pursue the invention and therefore may decide to abandon the patent application process The consequences of delay may be substantial If the invention is disclosed publicly then all international patent rights are forgone If a year passes after public disclosure without filing a regular patent application then U S patent rights are also forgone Nevertheless the team may be able to defer any action for several months before these eventualities are realized At some point after the team files a regular patent application or a PTO application the patent office will issue an action responding to the application In almost all cases a patent examiner will reject many or all of the claims as either obvious or not novel This is the norm and it is part of a back and forth exchange between the patent office and inventor that should eventually result in claims that are patentable Next the inventor and patent attorney sharpen arguments edit claims to reflect comments from the examiner and respond to the office action with an amended application Most applications eventually result in an issued patent although the claims rarely remain exactly as originally written The patent office does not review or act on provisional patent applications It merely records their filing and stores the application for review when and if a regular application is filed 348 Chapter 16 Step 7 Reflect on the Results and the Process In reflecting on the patent application or invention disclosure the team should consider at least the following questions What are the essential and distinctive features of the product concept and therefore the invention Are these features reflected in the description of the invention and in the claims Does the description communicate the best way of practicing the invention What is the timing of future required actions The team s patent attorney will typically maintain a docket essentially a calendar indicating when further actions must be taken to preserve patent rights However the inventor or someone within the team s company should also be responsible for thinking about the actions that must be taken in the coming months Which aspects of the process of preparing the patent application or invention disclosure went smoothly and which aspects require further efforts in the future What did the team learn about the prior art that may inform future product development efforts For example are there valuable technologies that might be licensed from existing patent holders Are competitors patents expiring possibly allowing the team to use a convenient solution to a long standing problem How strong an intellectual property position does the team have Are the features of the invention in the patent application so novel and valuable that they really prevent competitors from direct competition or is the patent likely to be merely a deterrent to the most direct copies of the products that embody the invention Did the team begin the process too early or too late Was the effort rushed What is the ideal timing for the next effort to prepare a patent application Summary A patent is a temporary monopoly granted by a government to exclude others from using making or selling an invention Patent law is intended to balance an incentive for invention with the free dissemination of information Utility patents are the central element of the intellectual property for most product development efforts An invention can be patented if it is useful novel and The final invention that is patented is defined by the patent claims The rest of the patent application essentially serves as background and explanation in support of the claims We recommend a seven step process for pursuing a patent 1 Formulate a strategy and plan 2 Study prior inventions 3 Outline claims 4 Write the description of the invention 5 Refine claims Patents and Intellectual Property 349 6 Pursue application 7 Reflect on the results and the process 0 Provisional patent applications and patent cooperation treaty PCT applications can be used to minimize the costs of pursuing patent protection while preserving all future options References and Bibliography Many current resources

but not claim an invention in a patent 350 Chapter 16 Appendix A Trademarks A trademark is a word or symbol associated with the products of a particular manufacturer Trademarks can form an important element of the portfolio of intellectual property owned by a company Trademarks can be words word marks stylized graphics spelling out words and or symbols Trademarks usually correspond to brands product names and sometimes to company names Trademark law is intended to prevent unfair competition which could result if one manufacturer named its products like those of another in an attempt to confuse the public In fact to avoid confusion when a manufacturer uses a competitor s trademark in advertising say for the purposes of comparison it must by law indicate that the name is a trademark of the competitor Trademarks must not be purely descriptive For example although a company could not obtain a trademark on Insulating Sleeve it could for names that are suggestive but not purely descriptive such as or In the United States a federal trademark may be established merely by using the mark in interstate commerce This is done by attaching TM to the word or symbol when used in advertising or labeling the product e g Trademarks may also be registered at modest cost through the United States Patent and Trademark Office using a simple process When registered a trademark is denoted with the symbol e g Coke Given the importance of the Internet for communicating with customers when creating new product names the team should strive to create trademarks that correspond exactly to domain names on the Internet Appendix B Advice to Individual Inventors Most students of product development and product development professionals have at some point had an idea for a novel product Often further thought results in a product concept which sometimes embodies a patentable invention A common misconception among inventors is that a raw idea or even a product concept is highly valuable Here is some advice based on observations of many inventors and product commercialization efforts A patent can be a useful element of a plan for developing and commercializing a product However it is not really a central element of that activity Patenting an invention can usually wait until many of the technical and market risks have been addressed 0 A patent by itself rarely has any commercial value An idea by itself has even less value To extract value from a product opportunity an inventor must typically complete a product design resolving the difficult trade offs associated with addressing customer needs while minimizing production costs Once this hard work is completed a product design may have substantial value In most cases pursuing a patent is and Intellectual Property 351 worth the effort except as part of a larger effort to take a product concept through to a substantial development milestone such as a working prototype If the design is proven through prototyping and testing a patent can be an important mechanism for increasing the value of this intellectual property Licensing a patent to a manufacturer as an individual inventor is very difficult If you are serious about your product opportunity be prepared to pursue commercialization of your product on your own or in partnership with a smaller company Once you have demonstrated a market for the product licensing to a larger entity becomes much more likely File a provisional patent application For very little money an individual using the guidelines in this chapter can file a provisional application This action provides patent protection for a year while you evaluate whether your idea is worth pursuing CHAPTER SEVENTEEN Product Development Economics 45 Polaroid Photo courtesy of Arne List EXHIBIT 17 1 One of Polaroid s digital color photo printers 353354 Chapter 17 A product development team at Polaroid Corporation was in the midst of developing a new photograph printer the CI 700 Exhibit 17 1 shows one of Polaroid s color photo printers The CI 700 would produce instant full color photographs from digital images stored in a computer The primary markets for the product are the graphic arts insurance and real estate industries During the CI 700 s development the Polaroid product development team was faced with several decisions that it knew could have a significant impact on the product s profitability Should the team take more time for development in order to make the product available on multiple computer platforms or would a delay in bringing the CI 700 to market be too costly Should the product use standard print media from Polaroid s existing businesses or new and specialized premium quality print media Should the team increase development spending in order to increase the reliability of the CI 700 The product development team needed tools to help it make these and other development decisions This chapter presents an economic analysis method for supporting the decisions of product development teams The process consists of two types of analysis quantitative and qualitative The emphasis in this chapter is on quick approximate methods for supporting decision making within the project team Elements of Economic Analysis Quantitative Analysis There are several basic cash inflows revenues and cash outflows costs in the life cycle of a successful new product Cash inflows come from product sales Cash outflows include spending on product and process development costs of production ramp up such as equipment purchases and tooling costs of marketing and supporting the product and ongoing production costs such as raw materials components and labor The cumulative cash inflows and outflows over the life cycle of a typical successful product are presented schematically in Exhibit 17 2 Economically successful products are profitable that is they generate more cumulative inflows than cumulative outflows A measure of the degree to which inflows are greater than outflows is the net present value of the project or the value in today s dollars of all of the expected future cash flows The quantitative part of the economic analysis method described in this chapter estimates the of a project s expected cash flows The method uses techniques because they are easily understood and used widely in business Appendix A provides a brief tutorial on The value of quantitative analysis is not only in providing objective evaluations of projects and alternatives but also in bringing a measure of structure and discipline to the assessment of product development projects Qualitative Analysis Quantitative analysis can capture only those factors that are measurable yet projects often have both positive and negative implications that are difficult to quantify Also Cumulative Inflow or Outflow Product Development Economics 355 Sales Revenues Time Development Cost Ramp up Costs Marketing and Support Costs Production Cost V EXHIBIT 1 7 2 Typical cash flows for a successful new product quantitative analysis rarely captures the characteristics of a dynamic and competitive environment The chief executive of a major American corporation underscores this point I had argue with me that a capital expenditure is wrong because it t have a payback within two or three years they ignore the fact that if we don t make the move we ll fall behind the rest of our industry in four or five years and Smith 1992 The method in this chapter uses qualitative analysis to capture some of these issues Our approach to qualitative analysis is to consider specifically the interactions between the project and l the firm 2 the market and 3 the macroeconomic environment When Should Economic Analysis Be Performed Economic analysis which includes both quantitative and qualitative approaches is useful in at least two different circumstances Go no go milestones For example should we try to develop a product to address this market opportunity Should we proceed with the implementation of a selected concept Should we launch the product we have developed These decisions typically arise at the end of each phase of development 356 Chapter 17 Operational design and development decisions Operational decisions involve questions such as Should we spend 100 000 to hire an outside firm to develop this component in order to save two months of development time Should we launch the product in four months at a unit cost of 450 or wait until six months when we can reduce the cost to 400 The analysis done at the beginning of a project can usually be updated with current information so that it does not have to be created in its entirety each time Used in this way the analysis becomes one of the information systems the team uses to manage the development project Economic analysis can be carried out by any member of the development team In small companies the project leader or one of the members of the core project team will implement the details of the analysis In larger companies a representative from a finance or planning group may be appointed to assist the development team in performing the analysis We emphasize that even when someone with formal training in financial modeling takes responsibility for this analysis the entire team should fully understand the analysis and be involved in its formulation and use Economic Analysis Process We recommend the following four step method for the economic analysis of a product development project 1 Build a base case financial model 2 Perform a sensitivity analysis to understand the relationships between financial success and the key assumptions and variables of the model 3 Use the sensitivity analysis to understand project trade offs 4 Consider the influence of the qualitative factors on project success The balance of this chapter is organized around these four steps Step 1 Build a Base Case Financial Model Constructing the base case model consists of estimating the timing and magnitude of future cash flows and then computing the of those cash flows Estimate the Timing and Magnitude of Future Cash Inflows and Outflows The timing and magnitude of the cash flows is estimated by merging the project schedule with the project budget sales volume forecasts and estimated production costs The level of detail of cash flows should be coarse enough to be convenient to work with yet it should contain enough resolution to facilitate effective decision making The most basic categories of cash flow for a typical new product development project are 0 Development cost all remaining design testing and refinement costs up to production ramp up Ramp up cost 0 Marketing and support cost EXHIBIT 1 7 3 CI 700 project budgets sales volume forecasts and production costs 357 Product Development Economics 0 Production cost Sales revenues Depending on the types of decisions the model will support greater levels of detail for one or more areas may be required More detailed modeling may consider these same five cash flows in greater detail or it may consider other flows Typical refinements include 0 Breakdown of production costs into direct costs and indirect costs i e overhead 0 Breakdown of marketing and support costs into launch costs promotion costs direct sales costs and service costs 0 Inclusion of tax effects including depreciation and investment tax credits Tax effects are typically considered in even simple financial modeling For the sake of clarity however we omit the tax effects in our examples Inclusion of such miscellaneous inflows and outflows as working capital requirements cannibalization the impact of the new product on existing product sales salvage costs and opportunity costs The financial model we use in this chapter is simplified to include only the major cash flows that are typically considered in practice but conceptually it is identical to more complex models The numerical values of the cash flows come from budgets and other estimates obtained from the development team the manufacturing organization and the marketing organization Exhibit 17 3 shows the relevant financial estimates for the CI 700 These data have been disguised to protect Polaroid s proprietary financial information For a more detailed discussion of manufacturing costs see Chapter 13 Design for Manufacturing Note that all revenues and expenses to date are sunk costs and are irrelevant to calculations The concept of sunk costs is reviewed in Appendix A In order to complete the model the financial estimates must be merged with timing information This can be done by considering the project schedule and sales plan Exhibit 17 4 shows the project timing information in chart form for the CI 700 For most projects a time increment of months or quarters is most appropriate The remaining time to market is estimated to be five quarters and product sales are anticipated to last 11 quarters A common method of representing project cash flow is a table The rows of the table are the different cash flow categories while the columns represent successive time periods Usually this table is encoded in a computer spreadsheet to facilitate analysis For this example we assume that the rate of cash flow for any category is constant across any time period e g total development spending of 5 million over one year is allocated equally to each of the four quarters however the values can be arranged in any way that best represents the team s forecast of the cash flows We multiply the unit sales quantity 1 Development cost 5 million 2 Ramp up cost 2 million 3 Marketing and support cost 1 million year 4 Unit production cost 400 unit 5 Sales and production volume 20 000 units year 6 Unit price 800 Chapter

Project is the sum of the discounted cash flows for each of the periods or 8 203 000 Here and in the rest of the chapter we round financial figures to the nearest one thousand dollars The Base Case Financial Model Can Support Go No Go Decisions and Major Investment Decisions The of this project according to the base case model is positive so the model supports and is consistent with the decision to proceed with development Such modeling can also be used to support major investment decisions Say for example that Polaroid was deciding between two different production facilities with different ramp up production and support costs The team could develop a model for each of the two scenarios and then compare the The scenario with the higher would better support the investment decision We now consider sensitivity analysis as a technique for readily understanding multiple scenarios for ongoing product development decisions Step 2 Perform Sensitivity Analysis Sensitivity analysis uses the financial model to answer what if questions by calculating the change in corresponding to a change in the factors included in the model Both internal and external factors influence project value Internal factors are those over which the development team has a large degree of influence including development program expense development speed production cost and product performance External factors are those that the team cannot arbitrarily change including the Chapter 17 EXHIBIT 1 7 7 Key factors influencing product development profitability Internal Factors External Factors 0

decrease in development spending environment e g market response actions of competitors sales volume and product price There may be disagreement over whether price is an internal or external factor In either case there is little disagreement that price is strongly influenced by the prices of competitive products and that it is coupled to sales volume While external factors are not directly controlled by product development teams they are often influenced by the internal factors The external and internal factors are shown in Exhibit 17 7 Development Cost Example As a first example let us consider the sensitivity of to changes in development cost By making incremental changes to development cost while holding other factors constant we can see the incremental impact on project For example what will be the change in if development cost is decreased by 20 percent A 20 percent decrease would lower the total development spending from 5 million to 4 million If development time remains one year then the spending per quarter would decrease from 1 25 million to 1 million This change is simply entered in the model and the resulting is calculated This change to the CI 700 s base

percentage increase of 11 8 in This is an extremely simple case we assume we can achieve the same project goals by spending 1 million less on development and we therefore have increased the project value by the present value of the 1 million in savings accrued over a time period of one year The CI 700 development cost sensitivity analysis for a range of changes is shown in Exhibit 17 9 The values in the table are computed by entering the changes corresponding to each scenario into the base case model and noting the results It is often useful to know the absolute dollar changes in as well as the relative percentage changes so we show both in the sensitivity table Development Time Example As a second example we calculate the development time sensitivities for the CI 700 model Consider the impact on project of a 25 percent increase in development time A 25 percent increase in development time would raise the time from four quarters to five quarters This increase in development time would also delay the start of production ramp up marketing efforts and product sales To perform the sensitivity analysis we must make several assumptions about the changes We assume the same total amount of development cost even though we will increase the time period over which the spending occurs thus lowering the rate of spending from 1 25 million to 1 0 million per quarter We also assume that there is a fixed window for sales which starts as soon as the product enters the market and ends in the fourth quarter of year 4 In effect we assume we can sell product from the time we are able to introduce it until a fixed date in the future Note that these assumptions are unique to this development project Different product development projects would require different assumptions as appropriate For example we might have instead assumed that the sales window simply shifts in time by one quarter The change to the Cl 700 s financial model is shown in Exhibit 17 10 Exhibit 17 11 presents the development time sensitivities for a range of changes We can see that a 25 percent increase in development time will decrease to 6 764 000 This represents a decrease in of 1 439 000 or 17 5 percent We recommend that sensitivities be computed for each of the external and internal factors with the exception of the competitive environment which is not explicitly contained in the base case model These sensitivity analyses inform the team about which Chapter 17 Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 values in thousands 01 02 04 01 02 03 04 01 03 0 4 01 02 04 Development cost 71 000 71

is useful in helping the team understand which factors should be studied in more detail in order to refine and improve the base case model The information is also useful in supporting the operating decisions of the team as discussed in the next step Sensitivity analysis shows that is highly dependent on uncertainties in some base case input values and less dependent on others In addition some of the input values used to compute the base case are more uncertain than others For example sales volume may be more uncertain than estimated unit production cost By assuming a range of high and low values for any uncertain inputs in the financial analysis the team can compute a range of possible values for The high and low values can be thought of as defining the range within which the team is highly confident the actual outcomes will fall This analysis can be summarized in a tornado chart showing the effect of each uncertainty on For the CI 700 project key uncertainties include the range of input values given in Exhibit 17 12 Changing these inputs in the model one at a time holding everything else constant yields the listed changes in Exhibit 17 13 shows these results graphically as a

would a product development team want to change the factors under its control For instance why should development time be increased if the change lowers the of the project Typically the development team will make such a change only if some other offsetting gain is expected such as a better quality product with higher sales volumes We therefore need to understand the relative magnitude of these financial interactions 364 Chapter 17 EXHIBIT 17 14 Potential interactions between internally driven factors Adapted from Smith and 1997 Development Product Time Cost Product Development Performance Cost Six Potential Interactions Development teams attempt to manage six potential interactions between the internally driven factors These potential interactions are shown schematically in Exhibit 17 14 The potential interaction between any two internal factors depends on the characteristics of the specific product context In many cases the interactions are trade offs For example decreasing development time may lead to lower product performance Increased product performance may require additional product cost However some of these interactions are more complex than a simple trade off For example decreasing product development time may require an increase in development spending yet extending development time may also lead to an increase in cost if the extension is caused by a delay in a critical task rather than by a planned extension of the schedule In general these interactions are important because of the linkage between the internal factors and the external factors For example increasing development cost or time may enhance product performance and therefore increase sales volume or allow higher prices Decreasing development time may allow the product to reach the market sooner and thus increase sales volume While accurate modeling of externally driven factors e g price sales volume is often very difficult the quantitative model can nevertheless support decision making Recall from our initial examples that the CI 700 development team was considering increasing development spending in order to develop a higher quality product which they hoped would lead to greater sales volume The quantitative model can support this decision by answering the question of how much the sales volume would have to increase to justify the additional spending on development We have calculated the sensitivity of to changes in development cost see Exhibit 17 9 We can also calculate the sensitivity of to changes in sales volume Exhibit 17 15 Say that the CI 700 development team is considering a 10 percent increase in development cost From Exhibit 17 9 we found that this increase in spending will decrease by 5 9 percent Now what increase in volume would be necessary to at least compensate for the decrease in From Exhibit 17 15 we know that a 10 percent increase in sales volume would increase by 21 percent It follows under assumptions of linearity that a 2 8 percent M 21 0 summarize a 10 percent increase in development cost would decrease by 5 9 percent A 2 8 percent increase in sales volume is needed to offset the drop While the J increase in sales volume would increase by 5 9 percent Development Economics 365 Change in Sales Volume o 20 10 base 1 O 20 30 Sales Change Change in Volume in Sales Change in S Thousands Volume S Thousands S Thousands 6 500 1 500

off rules for the CI 700 project precise impact of the increased development spending on sales volume is not known the model does provide a helpful guide for what magnitude of sales volume increase is needed to sustain particular increases in development cost Trade Off Rules The near linearity of many sensitivity analyses allows the team to compute some trade rules to inform day to day decision making These rules take the form of the cost per unit change in the internal and external factors For example what is the cost of a one month delay in development time What is the cost of a 10 percent development budget overrun What is the cost of a 1 per unit increase in manufacturing cost The trade off rules are easily computed from the base case model and can be used to inform the team of the relative magnitude of the sensitivities of the project profitability on factors under its control Exhibit 17 16 contains the rules for the CI 700 The trade off rules inform the original questions posed in the chapter introduction The team decided that waiting for software that would allow the printer to be used with both Apple Macintosh and Microsoft Windows operating systems would delay product introduction by two months It was calculated that the delay would have an approximate cost of 960 000 Rather than wait the team reasoned that it could introduce the product before all printer drivers were available as long as the drivers were offered as soon as they were available The media development group at Polaroid estimated that the development of Chapter 17 new print medium would cost more than 1 million and would take at least one year The team decided that these time and budget penalties did not warrant the marginal increase in print size and quality that would be enabled by the new medium Finally the team felt that the reliability of the product could be dramatically improved with the addition of only one engineer and one technician to the team This additional cost was expected to be approximately 100 000 for the remainder of the project The team noted that they would have to increase sales by only 0 6 percent to justify this investment Reliability was identified as a key customer need and so the team chose to aggressively pursue increased reliability Limitations of Quantitative Analysis Financial modeling and sensitivity analysis are powerful tools for supporting product development decisions but these techniques have important limitations One school of thought believes that rigorous financial analyses are required to bring discipline and control to the product development process However detractors argue that quantitative analysis suffers from some of the following problems It focuses only on measurable quantities Quantitative techniques like size and rely on that which is measurable However many critical factors impacting product development projects are difficult to measure accurately In effect quantitative techniques encourage investment in measurable assets and discourage investment in intangible assets It depends on validity of assumptions and data Product development teams may be lulled into a sense of security by the seemingly precise result of an calculation Financial analyses such as the ones we have shown in this chapter may seem to provide precise estimates of product development project value However such precision in no way implies accuracy We can develop a highly sophisticated financial model of a product development project that computes project to the fifth decimal place yet if the assumptions and data of our model are not correct the value calculated will not be correct Consider the CI 700 development time sensitivity example s assumption of a fixed product sales window This assumption was useful but its integrity can easily be questioned Indeed a different assumption could give dramatically different results Bureaucracy reduces productivity Detractors of financial analysis assert that such activities provide a high level of planning and control at the expense of product development productivity According to detractors extensive planning and review guarantee that a brilliantly conceived well engineered product will reach the market after its market window has already closed Detractors also argue that applied professional management techniques stifle the product development process Potentially productive development time is devoted to preparation of analyses and meetings The cumulative effect of this planning and review can be a ballooning development process These concerns are generally quite valid However in our opinion they are largely as with the blind application of the results of the quantitative analysis or arise from the combination of financial analysis with an already stifling bureaucracy We reject the notion that quantitative analysis should not be done just because problems can arise from the blind application of the results Rather development teams should understand Development Economics 367 strengths and limitations of the techniques and should be fully aware of how the models work and on what assumptions they are based Furthermore qualitative analysis as discussed in the next section can remedy some of the inherent weaknesses in the quantitative techniques Step 4 Consider the Influence of the Qualitative Factors on Project Success EXHIBIT 1 7 1 7 The broader context of a development project Many factors influencing development projects are difficult to quantify because they are complex or uncertain We refer to such factors as qualitative factors After providing a conceptual framework for qualitative analysis we use examples from the CI 700 to illustrate how the analysis is carried out Consider the following questions about the CI 700 project Will knowledge gained from the CI 700 development spill over and be of benefit to other Polaroid development projects How will competitors react to the introduction of the CI 700 Will competitors modify their own development efforts in response to Polaroid s actions Will there be significant fluctuations in the dollar yen exchange rate that would change the cost of component parts Our quantitative model implicitly accounts for these and many other issues with several broad assumptions The model assumes that decisions made by the project team do not affect actions of groups external to the project or alternatively that the external forces do not change the team s actions This important assumption of our model is common to many other financial models and is called the other things being equal assumption Projects Interact with the Firm the Market and the Macro Environment Decisions made within a project in general do have important consequences for the firm as a whole for competitors and customers in the market and even for the macroeconomic macro environment in which the market operates Exhibit 17 17 Similarly events and actions outside of a development project often significantly impact its value Qualitative analysis focuses largely on these interactions The most basic approach to qualitative analysis is to consider 1 the interactions between the project and the firm as a whole 2 the interactions between the project and the market in which the product will be sold and 3 the interactions between the project and the macro environment Macro Chapter 17 Interactions between the Project and the Firm as a Whole One assumption embedded in the quantitative model is that firm profit will be maximized if project profit is maximized However development decisions must be made in the context of the firm as a whole The two key interactions between the project and the firm are externalities and strategic fit Externalities An is an unpriced cost or benefit imposed on one part of the firm by the actions of a second costs are known as negative externalities and benefits as positive externalities As an example of a positive development learning on one project may benefit other current or future projects but is paid for by the first project How should the other projects account for such benefits gained at no additional cost How should the first project account for resources spent that benefit not only itself but also other current or future projects Strategic fit Decisions of the development team must not only benefit the project but also be consistent with the firm s overall product plan and technology strategy For example how well does a proposed new product technology or feature fit with the firm s resources and objectives Is it compatible with the firm s emphasis on technical excellence Is it compatible with the firm s emphasis on uniqueness Because of their complexity and uncertainty externalities and strategic fit are very difficult to quantify This does not mean these issues should not be considered rather they must be considered qualitatively See Chapter 4 Product Planning for discussion of some strategic planning issues that cut across multiple projects Interactions between the Project and the Market We have modeled explicitly only price and volume as the key externally driven factors In effect we have held the actions and reactions of the market constant To model project value accurately we must relax the assumption to recognize that a development team s decisions impact the market and that market events impact the development project The market environment is impacted by the actions of not only the development team but also three other groups Competitors Competitors may provide products in direct competition or products that compete indirectly as substitutes Customers Customers expectations incomes or tastes may change Changes may be independent or may be driven by new conditions in markets for complementary or substitute products Suppliers Suppliers of inputs to the new product are subject to their own markets competitive pressures These pressures may indirectly through the value chain impact the new product Actions and reactions of these groups most often impact expected price and volume but they can have second order effects as well For example consider a new competitor that has rapid product development cycles and that seems to value market share rather than short term profitability Clearly the entrance of such a new competitor would change our expected price and volume Further we may attempt to accelerate our own development efforts in response Thus the competitor s actions may impact not only our sales volume forecasts but also our planned development schedule Product Development Economics 369 Interactions between the Project and the Macro Environment We must relax the assumption to take into account key macro factors Major economic shifts Examples of typical major economic shifts that impact the value of development projects are changes in foreign exchange rates materials prices or labor costs Government regulations New regulations can destroy a product development opportunity On the other hand a shift in the regulatory structure of an industry can also spawn entire new industries Social trends As with government regulations new social concerns such as increased environmental awareness can also destroy existing industries or create new ones Macro factors can have important impacts on development project value However these effects are difficult to model quantitatively because of inherent complexity and uncertainty The product development team for the CI 700 faced many qualitative issues during development of the product We present three of the key qualitative issues that the Polaroid team encountered and describe the impacts of these issues on the project The examples illustrate not only the limitations of quantitative analysis but also the importance of qualitative analysis Carrying Out Qualitative Analysis For most project teams the most appropriate qualitative analysis method is simply to consider and discuss the interactions between the project and the firm the project and the market and the project and the macro environment Then the team considers these interactions in concert with the results of the quantitative analysis in order to determine the most appropriate relative emphasis on development speed development expense manufacturing cost and product performance We provide three examples below of the qualitative analysis for the Cl 700 While we believe this informal approach is most appropriate for decisions made at the level of the project team more structured techniques are available including strategic analysis game theory and scenario analysis techniques References for each of these techniques are included in the bibliography Example 1 Decrease in the Price of a Substitute Product Color laser printers are a substitute product for the Cl 700 While color laser printers are more costly than the Cl 700 they limit the potential of the Cl 700 s market by placing a ceiling on the price Polaroid can charge During the Cl 700 development manufacturers of color laser printers achieved several important technological breakthroughs The advances allowed the manufacturers to offer color laser printers at significantly lower prices The Polaroid team was faced with a change in the competitive environment that was caused by others and that invalidated fundamental assumptions of the financial model for the Cl 700 In this example it is clear that the CI 700 project cannot be considered in isolation The original sales volume forecasts incorporated implicit assumptions about the color laser printer market but the assumptions were invalidated by advances in color laser printer technology While the color laser printer breakthrough would have been Chapter 17 to predict quantitative analysis helped the CI 700 development team understand the sensitivity of the value of the project to this development By using the model to estimate the sensitivity of to changes in sales volume the team was able to quickly grasp the magnitude of the change in project value The combination of quantitative and qualitative analysis convinced the team to move more quickly and to further reduce the cost of the product for the project to remain viable Example 2 Increased Competition in a Complementary Product Market The demand for the CI 700 is closely linked to the prices of personal computers PCs PCs are said to be complementary products to the CI 700 because a decrease in the price of PCs increases demand for the CI 700 Cheaper PCs both increase PC sales and allow buyers to afford additional peripheral products such as the CI 700 Thus a decrease in the price of PCs would increase the value of the CI 700 project During the CI 700 development project intense competition in the PC market further increased with new entrants and rapid technological development The Polaroid team was faced with a change in the competitive environment for their product Quantitative analysis helped the CI 700 development team understand how project value was impacted By using the model to estimate the sensitivity of to changes in sales volume the team was able to quickly understand the magnitude of the change in project value which they hoped would partially offset the pressure from the falling prices for color printers Example 3 The Option Value of Creating a Good Platform Product The CI 700 was the first product of its kind produced by Polaroid and the development team recognized that many of their development decisions would impact potential future generations of the product line For example the ease with which future generation products could be built around the same basic technological platform depended upon design decisions made in the CI 700 project The team could choose to increase development spending and development time in order to facilitate the development of potential future generation products even if doing so would not make economic sense in the context of a single product They chose however to push ahead quickly with the CI 700 without extreme efforts to accommodate future models The argument was that the future of the market was so uncertain that the risk of not getting to market in time outweighed the potential usefulness of the product as a platform for future products Summary Product development teams must make many decisions in the course of a development project Economic analysis is a useful tool for supporting this decision making 0 The method consists of four steps 1 Build a base case financial model 2 Perform a sensitivity analysis to understand the relationships between financial success and the key assumptions and variables of the model 3 Use the sensitivity analysis to understand project trade offs 4 Consider the influence of qualitative factors on project success Product Development Economics 371 Quantitative analysis using techniques is practiced widely in business The technique forces product development teams to look objectively at their projects and their decisions At the very least they must go through the process of creating realistic project schedules and budgets Financial modeling provides a method for quantitatively understanding the key profit drivers of the project Quantitative techniques such as financial modeling and analysis rest upon assumptions about the external environment This environment is constantly changing and may be influenced by a development team s decisions or by other uncontrollable factors Further quantitative analysis by its very nature considers only that which is measurable yet many key factors influencing the project are highly complex or uncertain and are thus difficult to quantify Qualitative analysis emphasizes the importance of such difficult to quantify issues by asking specifically what the interactions are between the project and the rest of the firm the market and the macro environment 0 Together quantitative and qualitative techniques can help ensure that the team makes economically sound development decisions References and Bibliography Many current resources are available on the via u rich net provides an

products share any characteristics One model of the impact of a delay in product introduction is that sales are simply shifted later in time Another model is that some of the sales are pushed beyond the window of opportunity and are lost forever Can you suggest other models for the implications of an extension of product development time Is such an extension ever beneficial How would you use the

Money and the Net Present Value Technique This appendix provides a very basic tutorial on net present value for those who are unfamiliar with this concept Net present value is an intuitive and powerful concept In essence is simply a recognition of the fact that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow calculations evaluate the value today present value of some future income or expense Say that a bank will give an interest rate of 8 percent per time period the time period could be a month a quarter or a year long If we invest 100 today for one time period at an interest rate of 8 percent how much will the bank pay out after one time period If we let r be the interest rate and C be the amount invested then the amount received after one time period is 1 r x C 1 0 08 x 100 1 08 x 100 108 Thus if we invest 100 for one time period at an interest rate of 8 percent we will receive 108 at the end of the time period In other words 100 today is worth 108 received in the next time period Now let s say that we have invested some amount C for one time period at an interest rate r Let s also say that after the one time period the amount received back is 100 and the interest rate is 8 percent How much then was invested originally We can find C the original investment by doing the reverse of what we did in the previous example 1 r C 100 100 100 100 1 r 1 0 08 1 08 C 92 59 Thus if we invest 92 59 for one time period at an interest rate of 8 percent we will receive 100 at the end of the time period In other words 92 59 today is worth 100 received in the next time period We have just shown how a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow Of course 100 today is worth 100 But what is 100 received next time period worth in todays dollars The answer is 92 59 as we showed in the last example Stated another way the present value of 100 received in the next time period is 92 59 at a discount rate of 8 percent So present value is the value in today s dollars of some income received or expense paid out in a future period Now let s look at the result of investing 100 at 8 percent for longer periods One time period 1 r X C 1 X 0 08 X 100 108 Two time periods 1 r X 1 r X 100 1 0 08 2 X 100 116 64 Three time periods 1 r X 1 r X 1 r X 100 1 0 08 3 X 100 125 97374 Chapter 17 As we did earlier let s find the present value of three separate investments of 100 received after one two and three time periods One time period 1 r X C 100 C fl 92 59 1 0 08 The present value of 100 received next time period is 92 59 Two time periods 1 r X 1 r X C 100 C mi 85 7 1 0 08 2 The present value of 100 received after two time periods is 85 73 Three time periods 1 r X 1 r X 1 r X C 100 C 100 79 38 1 0 08 3 The present value of 100 received after three time periods is 79 3 8 We found the present value of these three separate investments Let s say instead that we had one investment that paid out 100 in each of time periods one two and three What would that investment be worth today The answer is simply the sum of the individual present values or 257 70 The sum of the present values is called the net present value or is the present value of all cash inflows and all cash outflows The present value of a cash outflow is just the negative of a cash inflow of the same amount We can summarize the present value calculation into a convenient formula The present value of an amount C received or paid out periods from now is C 1 r Some calculators have a special present value function on them that can do the calculations quickly Most computer spreadsheet programs have special financial functions that automatically do the present value calculations The information required for these special functions is the future amount paid out the interest rate and the number of time periods of the investment What Interest Rate Should We Use The interest rate also called the discount rate discount factor or hurdle rate to use is our own or our company s opportunity cost of capital It is called the opportunity cost of capital because it is the return forgone by investing in the project rather than in other investments Stated another way the discount factor is the reward that investors demand for accepting delayed payment A project that has a positive must be earning more than the opportunity cost of capital and is thus a good investment Note that many firms Development Economics 375 a constant hurdle rate to all their investment decisions In recent years most firms have been using discount factors of 10 to 20 percent Sunk Costs Are Irrelevant for Net Present Value Calculations In the context of product development decision making costs that have already been incurred are termed sunk costs Because sunk costs are past and irreversible outflows they cannot be affected by present or future decisions so they should be ignored for calculations To clarify this point let s consider an example of the familiar cut our losses argument We already spent over 600 million and nine years with no product to show for it and you want me to approve another 90 million That s crazy While this type of argument might sound logical in fact the amount of money already spent is not important for the decision of whether or not to spend 90 million more What is important is how much extra profit will be gained from investing the additional 90 million Say that the expected profit from product sales is 350 million Let s look at the of the two options assume all numbers given are present values Cut Our Losses Invest 90 Million More Additional amount invested 0 Additional amount invested Profits from product sales 0 Profits from product sales 350 of cut losses decision 0 of invest decision 260 Total invested 600 Total invested 690 Total project return 600 Total project return Because the invest decision has a positive the firm should proceed While it is clear that the firm will lose money on the project in either case the 600 million already spent is a sunk cost and should not impact the invest or cut losses decision Of course the sunk cost argument is a cold analytical perspective there is a saying that sunk costs are only relevant to the manager who sunk them Project managers with a long record of negative total project returns may find that sunk costs are extremely relevant to their ability to get support for future projects Appendix B Modeling Uncertain Cash Flows Using Net Present Value Analysis Product development projects face many perils For example the team may think that the manufacturing cost for a particular new product will be 40 per unit However the cost could be much higher or it might even be lower The team does not know for sure until the product is actually built The team may forecast sales for the new product but the forecasts depend on among other things when competitors get their versions to the market and this information will not be available until their products are actually introduced These uncertainties that are particular to a project are called project Specific risks Chapter 17 EXHIBIT 1 7 1 8 A situation in which two discrete scenarios can be envisioned should project specific risks be accounted for Some development teams increase the discount rate to offset uncertainty about the outcomes However such an arbitrary increment in the discount rate would be applied uniformly to both certain and uncertain cash flows Fortunately better approaches are available if the team is able to estimate the probabilities of uncertain cash flows Instead of using arbitrary adjustments to the discount rate development teams should strive for realistic forecasting of cash flows These forecasts can be supplemented with sensitivity analysis to understand the impact of the full range of possible outcomes for the uncertain factors Project specific risks should be considered only in the expected cash flows and not in the discount rate Sensitivity analysis can be performed by systematically varying the model parameters such as product price or manufacturing cost to understand how critically the net present value depends on specific values for these parameters A basic analysis can be performed one variable at a time as explained in the body of this chapter or combinations of variables can be adjusted to form realistic scenarios A more sophisticated analysis can be performed using Monte Carlo simulation based on assumed probability distributions for the parameters in the model Note that there is a second type of risk general market risk which is not specific to the project General market risk stems from the fact that there are perils which threaten all businesses and projects Although entire books on calculating market risk have been written for our purposes it suffices to say that market risk is typically accounted for by inflating the discount rate Analyzing Scenarios Sometimes project teams face discrete scenarios that are clearly foreseeable and that will have a direct and significant influence on the project outcome For example a team may have filed a patent application on a novel and distinctive product concept If the patent is allowed then the team expects to face much less of a competitive threat than if the patent is not allowed These two scenarios can be modeled as a decision tree as shown in Exhibit 17 18 In this case there is not an explicit decision but rather an outcome of an uncertain process These diagrams are nevertheless called decision trees by convention The two branches of this tree represent the two scenarios the team envisions The present value of the project can be analyzed for each scenario taken independently The team can also assign a probability to each scenario Given these inputs the team can now calculate the expected net present value for the project accounting for the two possible scenarios Pa Pb Pb 1 Patent Allowed 6 500 000 Launch Product Patent not Allowed 1 500 Development Economics 377 For the situation depicted by the decision tree shown in Exhibit 17 18 0 60 X 6 500 000 0 40 X 1 500 000 4 500 000 This kind of analysis is appropriate when discrete and distinct scenarios can be envisioned and when these scenarios have substantially different cash flows Analyzing Scenarios with Decision Points When analyzing product development projects the team should recognize that most development projects can be discontinued or redirected based on the latest information available Such decision points may occur at the time of major milestones or reviews This flexibility to expand or contract a project is financially valuable The notion of decision points with the ability to change an investment is the subject of an entire field of analysis called real options Copeland and 2003 provide a detailed treatment of this subject Here we provide a way to think about scenarios containing decision points Consider the scenario depicted in Exhibit 17 19 A team is contemplating the launch of a product in an entirely new category which is an inherently risky type of project The team could just launch the project and hope for success or it could spend time and money testing the product in the marketplace If it invests in market testing the team may discover that the product is not viable in which case it has the option to cancel the project Alternatively it may discover that the market is highly responsive to the new product in which case it can launch with confidence and a much higher associated expected value of the future cash flows As a base case the team analyzes the value of just launching the product without investigation Given the team s assessment of the likelihood of success the present value is 2 million for this plan The value of market testing followed by a decision to proceed or not can be analyzed as follows In this case the team spends an additional 1 million for investigation After investigation there is a 70 percent chance that the team will launch the product and reap Launch Product with High Market Risk 0 2 000 000 Launch Product with Low Market Risk 5 000 000 O 1 000 000 Pb 30 Cancel Project and Salvage Assets 500 000 EXHIBIT 1 7 1 9 In this situation the team can either launch the product immediately and face a great deal of market risk or it can test the market and then decide whether to launch the product 378 Chapter 17 positive cash flow of 5 million There is a 30 percent chance that the team will decide to cancel the project reaping only 0 5 million in salvage value Thus the net present value of the project is Pa 191 1 000 000 0 70 x 5 000 000 0 30 x 500 000 2 650 000 Based on these estimates because the net present value exceeds that of just launching the product without testing the team would be better off spending the 1 million to test the market There are of course many factors that influence a decision about whether to launch a product with high uncertainty or to perform further investigation Economic modeling can be used as one perspective for informing this kind of decision CHAPTER EIGHTEEN Managing Projects Courtesy of Eastman Kodak Company EXHIBIT 1 8 1 The Cheetah microfilm cartridge 379380 Chapter 18 A manufacturer of microfilm imaging equipment approached the Eastman Kodak Company to design and supply the microfilm cartridges for use with a new machine under development Exhibit 18 1 The target specifications were similar to previous products developed by the cartridge group at Kodak However in contrast to the usual 24 month development time the customer needed prototype cartridges for demonstration at a trade show in just 8 months and production was to begin 4 months later Kodak accepted this challenge of cutting its normal development time in half and called its efforts the Cheetah project Effective project management was crucial to the successful completion of the project For all but the simplest products product development involves many people completing many different tasks Successful product development projects result in high quality low cost products while making efficient use of time money and other resources Project management is the activity of planning and coordinating resources and tasks to achieve these goals Project management activities occur during project planning and project execution Project planning involves scheduling the project tasks and determining resource requirements The project plan is first laid out during the concept development phase although it is a dynamic entity and continues to evolve throughout the development process Project execution sometimes called project control involves coordinating and facilitating the myriad tasks required to complete the project in the face of inevitable unanticipated events and the arrival of new information Execution is just as important as planning many teams fail because they do not remain focused on their goals for the duration of the project This chapter contains five remaining sections We first present the fundamentals of task dependencies and timing along with three tools for representing relationships among project tasks In the second section we show how these principles are used to develop an effective product development plan In the third section we provide a set of guidelines for completing projects more quickly After that we discuss project execution and finally we present a process for project evaluation and continuous improvement Understanding and Representing Tasks Product development projects involve the completion of hundreds or even thousands of tasks This section discusses some of the fundamental characteristics of interacting tasks the basic physics of projects We also present three ways to represent the tasks in a project Sequential Parallel and Coupled Tasks Exhibit 18 2 displays the tasks for three portions of the Cheetah project The tasks are represented by boxes and the information data dependencies among the tasks are represented by arrows We refer to this representation as an information processing view or a data driven perspective of product development because most of the dependencies involve transfer of information data between the tasks We say that task B is dependent on task A if an output of task A is required to complete task B This dependency is denoted by an arrow from task A to task B EXHIBIT

Sequential Produce Beta Cartridges Design Beta Test Beta Cartridges Cartridges Develop Testing Program b Parallel Design Production Cartridge Purchase Test Beta E Design Cartridges Mold l Design Assembly c Coupled Exhibit 18 2 a shows three tasks two of which are dependent on the output of another task These tasks are sequential because the dependencies impose a sequential order in which the tasks must be completed Note that when we refer to tasks being completed sequentially we do not necessarily mean that the later task cannot be started before the earlier one has been completed Generally the later task can begin with partial information but cannot finish until the earlier task has been completed Exhibit 18 2 b shows four development tasks The middle two tasks depend only on the task on the left but not on each other The task on the right depends on the middle two tasks We call the middle two tasks parallel because they are both dependent on the same task but are independent of each other Exhibit 18 2 c shows five development tasks three of which are coupled Coupled tasks are mutually dependent each task requires the result of the other tasks in order to be completed Coupled tasks either must be executed simultaneously with continual exchanges of information or must be carried out in an iterative fashion When coupled tasks are completed iteratively the tasks are performed either sequentially or simultaneously with the understanding that the results are tentative and that each task will most likely be repeated one or more times until the team converges on a solution 382 Chapter 18 EXHIBIT 1 8 3 Simplified design structure matrix for the Kodak Cheetah project The Design Structure Matrix A useful tool for representing and analyzing task dependencies is the design structure matrix This representation was originally developed by Steward 1981 for the analysis of design descriptions and has more recently been used to analyze development projects modeled at the task level et 1994 2001 Exhibit 18 3 shows a for the 14 major tasks of the Cheetah project Kodak s actual plan included more than 100 tasks In a model a project task is assigned to a row and a corresponding column The rows and columns are named and ordered identically although generally only the rows list the complete names of the tasks Each task is defined by a row of the matrix We represent a task s dependencies by placing marks in the columns to indicate the other tasks columns on which it depends Reading across a row reveals all of the tasks whose output is required to perform the task corresponding to the row Reading down a column reveals which tasks receive information from the task corresponding to the column The diagonal cells are usually filled in with dots or the task labels simply to separate the upper and lower triangles of the matrix and to facilitate tracing dependencies The is most useful when the tasks are listed in the order in which they are to be executed In most cases this order will correspond to the order imposed by sequential dependencies Note that if only sequentially dependent tasks were contained in the then the tasks could be sequenced such that the matrix would be lower triangular that is no marks would appear above the diagonal A mark appearing above the diagonal has special significance it indicates that an earlier task is dependent on a later task An above diagonal mark could mean that two sequentially dependent tasks are ordered backward in which case the order of the tasks can be changed to eliminate the mark However when there is no ordering of the tasks that will eliminate an above diagonal mark the mark reveals that two or more tasks are coupled Changing the order of tasks is called sequencing or partitioning the Simple algorithms are available for partitioning such that the tasks are ordered as much as possible according to the sequential dependencies of the tasks Inspection of a partitioned reveals which tasks are sequential which are parallel and which are coupled and will require simultaneous solution or iteration In a partitioned a task is part of a sequential group if its row contains a mark just below the diagonal Two or Task Receive and accept specification A A Concept generation selection B X B Tasks Design beta cartridges C X X C Parallel Tasks Produce beta

linking them As noted coupled tasks are identified by above diagonal marks Exhibit 18 3 shows how the reveals all three types of relationships More sophisticated use of the method has been a subject of research at MIT since the Much of this work has applied the method to larger projects and to the development of complex systems such as automobiles and airplanes Analytical methods have been developed to help understand the effects of complex task coupling Smith and 1997 to predict the distribution of possible project completion times and costs and 2001 and to help plan organization designs based on product architectures 1997 practitioners have found that creative uses of the s graphical display of project task relationships can be highly insightful for project managers in both the planning and execution phases The chapter appendix presents a larger model in which several overlapping phases of coupled development activities are represented Charts The traditional tool for representing the timing of tasks is the chart Exhibit 18 4 shows a chart for the Cheetah project The chart contains a horizontal time line created by drawing a horizontal bar representing the start and end of each task The filled in portion of each bar represents the fraction of the task that is complete The vertical line in Exhibit 18 4 shows the current date so we can observe directly that task D is behind schedule while task E is ahead of schedule A chart does not explicitly display the dependencies among tasks Task dependencies constrain but do not fully determine the timing of the tasks The dependencies dictate which tasks must be completed before others can begin or finish depending on Tasks Completed A B C E Behind Schedule D A accept spec Ahead of Schedule E B Concept

1 8 4 chart for the Cheetah project 384 Chapter 18 EXHIBIT 1 8 5 PERT chart for the Cheetah project The critical path is designated by the thicker lines connecting tasks Note that tasks G H and I are grouped together because the PERT representation does not depict coupled tasks explicitly the nature of the dependency and which tasks can be completed in parallel When two tasks overlap in time on a chart they may be parallel sequential or iteratively coupled Parallel tasks can be overlapped in time for convenience in project scheduling because they do not depend on one another Sequential tasks might be overlapped in time depending on the exact nature of the information dependency as described below in the section on accelerating projects Coupled tasks must be overlapped in time because they need to be addressed simultaneously or in an iterative fashion PERT Charts PERT program evaluation and review technique charts explicitly represent both dependencies and timing in effect combining some of the information contained in the and chart While there are many forms of PERT charts we prefer the activities on nodes form of the chart which corresponds to the process diagrams that most people are familiar with The PERT chart for the Cheetah project is shown in Exhibit 18 5 The blocks in the PERT chart are labeled with both the task and its expected duration Note that the PERT representation does not allow for loops or feedback and so cannot explicitly show iterative coupling As a result the coupled tasks G H and I are grouped together into one task The graphical convention of PERT charts is that all links between tasks must proceed from left to right indicating the temporal sequence in which tasks can be completed When the blocks are sized to represent the duration of tasks as in a chart then a PERT diagram can also be used to represent a project schedule The Critical Path The dependencies among the tasks in a PERT chart some of which may be arranged sequentially and some of which may be arranged in parallel lead to the concept of a critical path The critical path is the longest chain of dependent events This is the single Receive accept specification Concept

Develop testing program Test beta cartridges Design production cartridge Task A 2 Duration weeks Managing Projects 385 sequence of tasks whose combined required times define the minimum possible completion time for the entire set of tasks Consider for example the Cheetah project represented in Exhibit 18 5 Either the sequence C D F or the sequence C E F defines how much time is required to complete the four tasks C D E and F In this case the path C D F requires 18 weeks and the path C E F requires 15 weeks so the critical path for the whole project includes C D F The critical path for the project is denoted by the thick lines in Exhibit 18 5 Identifying the critical path is important because a delay in any of these critical tasks would result in an increase in project duration All other paths contain some slack meaning that a delay in one of the noncritical tasks does not necessarily create a delay for the entire project Exhibit 18 4 shows that task D is behind schedule Because task D is on the critical path this delay if not corrected will result in a delay of the completion of the entire project Several software packages are available for producing charts and PERT charts these programs can also compute the critical path Baseline Project Planning The project plan is the for the remaining development effort The plan is important in coordinating the remaining tasks and in estimating the required development resources and development time Some measure of project planning occurs at the earliest stages of product development but the importance of the plan is highest at the end of the concept development phase just before significant development resources are committed This section presents a method for creating a baseline project plan After establishing this baseline the team considers whether it should modify the plan to change the planned development time budget or project scope The results of the concept development phase plus the project plan make up the contract book The Contract Book We recommend that a contract book be used to document the project plan and the results of the concept development phase of the development process The concept of a contract book is detailed by Wheelwright and Clark 1992 The word contract is used to emphasize that the document represents an agreement between the development team and the senior management of the company about project goals direction and resource requirements The book is sometimes actually signed by the key team members and the senior managers of the company A table of contents for a contract book is shown in Exhibit 18 6 along with references to the chapters in this book where some of these contents are discussed Below we discuss elements of the project plan the project task list team staffing and organization the project schedule the project budget and the project risk areas Project Task List We have already introduced the idea that a project consists of a collection of tasks The first step in planning a project is to list the tasks that make up the project For most product development projects the team will not be able to list every task in great detail too much uncertainty remains in the subsequent development activities However the team will be able to list its best estimate of the remaining tasks at a general level of detail To be most useful during project planning the task list should contain from 50 to 200386 Chapter 18 EXHIBIT 1 8 6 Table of contents of a contract book for a project of moderate complexity Item Approximate Pages See Chapter s Mission Statement

correspond on average to a day or two of work for a single individual For medium sized projects such as the development of a computer printer each task may correspond to a week of work for a small group of people For a large project such as the development of an automobile each task may correspond to one or more months of efforts for an entire division or For large projects each of the tasks identified at this level may be treated as its own development project with its own project plan An effective way to tackle the generation of the task list is to consider the tasks in each of the remaining phases of development For our generic development process the phases remaining after concept development are system level design detail design testing and refinement and production ramp up See Chapter 2 Development Processes and Organizations In some cases the current effort will be very similar to a previous project In these cases the list of tasks from the previous project is a good starting point for the new task list The Cheetah project was very similar to dozens of previous efforts For this reason the team had no trouble identifying the project tasks Its challenge was to complete them quickly After listing all of the tasks the team estimates the effort required to complete each task Effort is usually expressed in units of person hours person days or person weeks depending on the size of the project Note that these estimates reflect the actual working time that members of the development team would have to apply to the task and not the elapsed calendar time the team expects the task to require Because the speed with which a task is completed has some influence on the total amount of effort that must be applied to the task the estimates embody preliminary assumptions about the overall project schedule and how quickly the team will attempt to complete tasks These estimates are typically derived from past experience or the judgment of experienced members of the development team A task list for the Cheetah project is shown in Exhibit 18 7 EXHIBIT 1 8 7 Task list for the Cheetah project This task list is abbreviated for clarity the actual list contained over 100 tasks Managing Projects 387 Task Estimated Person Weeks Concept Development Receive and accept specification Concept generation selection Detail Design Design beta cartridges Produce beta

project tasks Whether or not this team is effective depends on a wide variety of individual and organizational factors Smith and 1997 propose seven criteria as determinants of the speed with which a team will complete product development in our experience these criteria predict many of the other dimensions of team performance as well team There are 10 or fewer members of the team Members volunteer to serve on the team Members are assigned to the team full time Members report directly to the team leader Members serve on the team from the time of concept development until product launch The key functions including at least marketing design and manufacturing are on the 7 Members are located within conversational distance of each other While few teams are staffed and organized ideally these criteria raise several key issues How big should the team be How should the team be organized relative to the larger enterprise Which functions should be represented on the team How can the development team of a very large project exhibit some of the agility of a small team Here we address the issues related to team size Chapter 1 Introduction and Chapter 2 Development Processes and Organizations address some of the other team and organizational issues 388 Chapter 18 The minimum number of people required on the project team can be estimated by dividing the total estimated time to complete the project tasks by the planned project duration For example the estimated task time for the Cheetah project was 354 person weeks The team hoped to complete the project in 12 months or about 50 weeks so the minimum possible team size would be seven people All other things being equal small teams seem to be more efficient than large teams so the ideal situation would be to have a team made up of the minimum number of people each dedicated 100 percent to the project Three factors make realizing this ideal difficult First specialized skills are often required to complete the project For example one of the Cheetah tasks was to design molds Mold designers are highly specialized and the team could not use a mold designer for a full year Second one or more key team members may have other unavoidable responsibilities For example one of the engineers on the Cheetah project was responsible for assisting in the production ramp up of a previous project As a result she was only able to commit half of her time to the Cheetah project initially Third the work required to complete tasks on the project is not constant over time In general the work requirement increases steadily until the beginning of production ramp up and then begins to taper off As a result the team will generally have to grow in size as the project progresses in order to complete the project as quickly as possible After considering the need for specialized skills the reality of other commitments of the team members and the need to accommodate an increase and subsequent decrease in workload the project leader in consultation with his or her management identifies the full project staff and approximately when each person will join the team When possible team members are identified by name although in some cases they will be identified only by area of expertise e g mold designer industrial designer The project staffing for the Cheetah project is shown in Exhibit 18 8 Project Schedule The project schedule is the merger of the project tasks and the project time line The schedule identifies when major project milestones are expected to occur and when each project task is expected to begin and end The team uses this schedule to track progress Person Month 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 O 1 1 1 2 Team Leader 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 Schedule Coordinator 25 25 25 25 25 25 25 25 25 25 25 25

Cheetah project Numbers shown are approximate percentages of full time Managing Projects 389 and to orchestrate the exchange of materials and information between individuals It is therefore important that the schedule is viewed as credible by the entire project team We recommend the following steps to create a baseline project schedule Use the or PERT chart to identify the dependencies among tasks Position the key project milestones along a time line in a chart Schedule the tasks considering the project staffing and other critical resources Adjust the timing of the milestones to be consistent with the time required for the tasks Project milestones are useful as anchor points for the scheduling activity Common milestones include design reviews also called phase reviews or design gates comprehensive prototypes e g alpha prototype beta prototype and trade shows Because these events typically require input from almost everyone on the development team they serve as powerful forces for integration and act as anchor points on the schedule Once the milestones are laid out on the schedule the tasks can be arranged between these milestones The Cheetah schedule was developed by expanding the typical project phases into a set of approximately 100 tasks The major milestones were the concept approval the testing of beta prototype cartridges the trade show demonstration and production ramp up Relationships among these activities and the critical path were documented using a combined PERT chart Project Budget Budgets are customarily represented with a simple spreadsheet although many companies have standard budgeting forms for requests and approvals The major budget items are staff materials and services specific facilities and spending on outside development resources For most projects the largest budget item is the cost of staff For the Cheetah project personnel charges made up 80 percent of the total budget The personnel costs can be derived directly from the staffing plan by applying the loaded salary rates to the estimated time commitments of the staff on the project Loaded salaries include employee benefits and overhead and are typically between two and three times the actual salary of the team member Many companies use only one or two different rates to represent the cost of the people on a project Average staff costs for product development projects range from 2 000 to 5 000 per person week For the Cheetah project assuming an average cost of 3 000 per person week the total cost for the 354 person weeks of effort would be 1 062 000 Early in the development project uncertainty of both timing and costs are high and the forecasts may only be accurate within 30 to 50 percent In the later stages of the project the program uncertainty is reduced to perhaps 5 percent to 10 percent For this reason some margin should be added to the budget as a contingency A summary of the Cheetah project budget is shown in Exhibit 18 9 Project Risk Plan Projects rarely proceed exactly according to plan Some of the deviations from the plan are minor and can be accommodated with little or no impact on project performance Other deviations can cause major delays budget overruns poor product performance or high manufacturing costs Often the team can assemble in advance a list of what might go wrong that is the areas of risk for the project To identify risks the team asks Chapter 18 EXHIBIT 1 8 1 0 Risk plan for the Cheetah project Item Amount Staff salaries 354 person weeks 3 000 week 1 062 000 Materials and Services 125 000 Prototype

market acceptance material costs competition and so on After identifying each risk the team can prioritize the risks To do so some teams use a scale combining severity and likelihood of each risk A complete risk plan also includes a list of actions the team will take to minimize the risk It is good project management practice to address the biggest risks as early as possible in the project This is done by scheduling early actions to reduce the uncertainty underlying the high risks that have been identified In addition to pushing the team to work to minimize risk the explicit focus on risk during the project planning activity helps to minimize the number of surprises the team will have to communicate to its senior management later in the project The risk plan for the Cheetah project is shown in Exhibit 18 10 Managing Projects 391 Modifying the Baseline Plan The baseline project plan embodies assumptions about how quickly the project should be completed about the performance and cost goals for the product and about the resources to be applied to the project After completing a baseline plan the team should consider whether some of these assumptions should be revisited In particular the team can usually choose to trade off development time development cost product manufacturing cost product performance and risk For example a project can sometimes be completed more quickly by spending more money Some of these trade offs can be explored quantitatively using the economic analysis techniques described in Chapter 17 Product Development Economics The team may also develop contingency plans in case certain risks cannot be overcome The most common desired modification to the baseline plan is to compress the schedule For this reason we devote the next section to ways the team can accelerate the project Accelerating Projects Product development time is often the dominant concern in project planning and execution This section provides a set of guidelines for accelerating product development projects Most of these guidelines are applicable at the project planning stage although a few can be applied throughout a development project Accelerating a project before it has begun is much easier than trying to expedite a project that is already under way The first set of guidelines applies to the project as a whole Start the project early Saving a month at the beginning of a project is just as helpful as saving a month at the end of a project yet teams often work with little urgency before development formally begins For example the meeting to approve a project plan and review a contract book is often delayed for weeks because of difficulty in scheduling a meeting with senior managers This delay at the beginning of a project costs exactly as much time as the same delay during production ramp up The easiest way to complete a project sooner is to start it early Manage the project scope There is a natural tendency to add additional features and capabilities to the product as development progresses Some companies call this phenomenon feature creep or creeping elegance and in time sensitive contexts it may result in an elegant product without a market Disciplined teams and organizations are able to freeze the design and leave incremental improvements for the next generation of the product Facilitate the exchange of essential information As shown in the representation a tremendous amount of information must be transferred within the product development team Every task has one or more internal customers for the information it produces For small teams frequent exchange of information is quite natural and is facilitated by team meetings and of team members Larger teams may require more structure to promote rapid and frequent information exchange Blocks of coupled tasks revealed by the identify the specific needs for intensive information exchange Computer networks and collaboration software tools can facilitate regular information transfer within large and dispersed product development teams The second set of guidelines is aimed at decreasing the time required to complete the tasks on the critical path These guidelines arise from the fact that the only way to Chapter 18 Start the time required to complete a project is to shorten the critical path Note that a decision to allocate additional resources to shortening the critical path should be based on the value of accelerating the entire project For some projects time reductions on the critical path can be worth hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars per week Complete individual tasks on the critical path more quickly The benefit of recognizing the critical path is that the team can focus its efforts on this vital sequence of tasks The critical path generally represents only a small fraction of the total project effort and so additional spending on completing a critical task more quickly can usually quite easily be justified Sometimes completing critical tasks more quickly can be achieved simply by identifying a task as critical so that it gets special attention starts earlier and is not interrupted Note that the accelerated completion of a critical task may cause the critical path to shift to include previously noncritical tasks Aggregate safety times The estimated duration of each task in the project generally includes some amount of safety time This time accounts for the many normal but unpredictable delays that occur during the execution of each task Common delays include waiting for information and approvals interruptions from other tasks or projects and tasks being more difficult than anticipated 1997 estimates that built in safety doubles the nominal duration of tasks Although safety time is added to the expected task duration to account for random delays these estimates become targets during execution of the tasks which means that tasks are rarely completed early and many tasks overrun recommends removing the safety time from each task along the critical path and aggregating all of the safety time from the critical path into a single project placed at the end of the project schedule Because the need to extend task duration occurs somewhat randomly only some of the tasks will actually need to utilize time from the project buffer Therefore a single project buffer can be smaller than the sum of the safety times that would be included in each estimate of task duration and the critical path may be completed sooner In practice the project buffer may only need to start with time equal to half of the shortened critical path duration has developed these ideas into a project management method called Critical Chain In addition to the project buffer the method uses feeder to protect the critical path from delays where noncritical tasks feed into the critical path Each feeder buffer aggregates the safety times of the tasks on a noncritical path Exhibit 18 11 illustrates the use of project and feeder buffers Finish EXHIBIT 1 8 1 1 The Critical Chain method aggregates the safety time along the critical path into the project buffer Feeder buffers protect the critical path from delays In this illustration nominal task durations in days are given for each task and the critical path is shown with thicker arrows linking the critical tasks Managing Projects 393 Eliminate some critical path tasks entirely Scrutinize each and every task on the critical path and ask whether it can be removed or accomplished in another way Eliminate waiting delays for critical path resources Tasks on the critical path are sometimes delayed by waiting for a busy resource The waiting time is frequently longer than the actual time required to complete the task Delays due to waiting are particularly prominent when procuring special components from suppliers Sometimes such delays can be avoided by ordering an assortment of materials and components in order to be sure to have the right items on hand or by purchasing a fraction of the capacity of a vendor s production system in order to expedite the fabrication of prototype parts These expenses may make perfect economic sense in the context of the overall development project even though the expenditure may seem extravagant when viewed in isolation In other cases administrative tasks such as purchase order approvals may become bottlenecks Because in past cartridge development projects periodic budget approvals had caused delays the Cheetah project leader began early to pursue aggressively the necessary signatures so as not to hold up the activities of the entire team Overlap selected critical tasks By scrutinizing the relationships between sequentially dependent tasks on the critical path the tasks can sometimes be overlapped or executed in parallel In some cases this may require a significant redefinition of the tasks or even changes to the architecture of the product See Chapter 10 Product Architecture for more details on dependencies arising from the architecture of the product In other cases overlapping entails simply transferring partial information earlier and or more frequently between nominally sequential tasks or freezing the critical upstream information earlier 1996 provides a framework for choosing various overlapping strategies Pipeline large tasks The strategy of pipelining is applied by breaking up a single large task into smaller tasks whose results can be passed along as soon as they are completed For example the process of finding and qualifying the many vendors that supply the components of a product can be time consuming and can even delay the production ramp up if not completed early enough Instead of waiting until the entire bill of materials is complete before the purchasing department begins qualifying vendors purchasing could qualify vendors as soon as each component is identified Pipelining in effect allows nominally sequential tasks to be overlapped Outsource some tasks Project resource constraints are common When a project is constrained by available resources assigning tasks to an outside firm or to another group within the company may prove effective in accelerating the overall project The final set of guidelines is aimed at completing coupled tasks more quickly Recall that coupled tasks are those that must be completed simultaneously or iteratively because they are mutually dependent Perform more iterations quickly Much of the delay in completing coupled tasks is in passing information from one person to another and in waiting for a response If the iteration cycles can be completed at a higher frequency then the coupled tasks can sometimes be completed more quickly Faster iterations can be achieved through faster and more frequent information exchanges In the Cheetah project the mechanical engineer would work closely with the mold designer who would in turn work closely with the mold maker In many cases these three would share a single computer Chapter 18 for the purpose of exchanging ideas about how the design was evolving from their three different perspectives Decouple tasks to avoid iterations Iterations can often be reduced or eliminated by taking actions to decouple tasks For example by clearly defining an interface between two interacting components early in the design process the subsequent design of the two components can proceed independently and in parallel The definition of the interface may take some time in advance but the avoidance of time consuming iterations may result in net time savings See Chapter 10 Product Architecture for a discussion of establishing interfaces in order to allow the independent development of components Consider sets of solutions Iterations involve the exchange of information about the evolving product design Rather than exchanging point value estimates of design parameters in some cases the use of ranges or sets of values may facilitate faster convergence of coupled tasks Researchers have recently described the application of such set based approaches to concurrent engineering at Toyota et 1999 Project Execution Smooth execution of even a well planned project requires careful attention Three problems of project execution are particularly important 1 What mechanisms can be used to coordinate tasks 2 How can project status be assessed and 3 What actions can the team take to correct for undesirable deviations from the project plan We devote this section to these issues Coordination Mechanisms Coordination among the activities of the different members of the team is required throughout a product development project The need for coordination is a natural outgrowth of dependencies among tasks Coordination needs also arise from the inevitable changes in the project plan caused by unanticipated events and new information Difficulties in coordination can arise from inadequate exchanges of information and from organizational barriers to cross functional cooperation Here are several mechanisms used by teams to address these difficulties and facilitate coordination Informal communication A team member engaged in a product development project may communicate with other team members dozens of times per day Many of these communications are informal they involve a spontaneous stop by someone s desk a telephone call or e mail to request or provide a piece of information Good informal communication is one of the mechanisms most useful in breaking down individual and organizational barriers to cross functional cooperation Informal communication is dramatically enhanced by locating the core members of the development team in the same work space Allen 1977 has shown that communication frequency is inversely related to physical separation and falls off rapidly when people are located more than a few meters from one another Exhibit 18 12 In our experience e mail and to a lesser extent voice mail also provide effective means of fostering informal communication among people who are already well acquainted with one another Meetings The primary formal communication mechanism for project teams is meetings Most teams meet formally at least once each week Many teams meet twice each week and some teams meet every day Teams located in the same work space need fewer formal meetings than those whose members are geographically separated 18 12 Communication frequency versus separation distance This relationship shown is for individuals with an organizational bond such as belonging to the same product development team Source Based on Allen 1977 Managing Projects 395 25 N o o I 15 Probability of Communicating at Least Once per Week 6 o 5 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 Separation Distance Meters spent exchanging information in meetings is time not spent completing other project tasks In order to minimize the amount of time wasted in meetings some teams that hold frequent meetings meet standing up to emphasize that the meeting is intended to be quick Other techniques for controlling the length of meetings include preparing a written agenda appointing someone to run the meeting and holding the meeting just before lunchtime or near the end of the day when people are anxious to leave We recommend that team meetings be held at a regular time and place so that no extra effort is expended in scheduling the meeting and in informing the team of its time and location Schedule display The most important information system in project execution is the project schedule usually in the form of a PERT or chart Most successful projects have a single person who is responsible for monitoring the schedule On small projects this is usually the team leader Larger projects generally have a designated person other than the project leader who watches and updates the schedule regularly On the Cheetah project Kodak provided a part time project analyst who kept the schedule current on a weekly basis and reported to the project team leader The team members understood the importance of accurate schedule projections and were very cooperative in this effort Schedule updates are usually displayed in chart form Exhibit 18 4 Weekly updates The weekly status memo is written by the project leader and is distributed on paper by e mail or even by voice mail to the entire extended project team usually on Friday or over the weekend The memo is usually one or two pages long and lists the key accomplishments decisions and events of the past week It also lists the key events of the coming week It is sometimes accompanied by an updated schedule Incentives Some of the most basic organizational forms such as functional organizations that use functional performance reviews may inhibit the productive collaboration of team members across functions The implementation of project based performance measures creates incentives for team members to contribute more fully to the project Having both a project manager and a functional manager contribute to individual performance reviews leading to promotions merit increases and bonuses sends a strong message that project results are highly valued See Chapter 2 Development Chapter 18 and Organizations for a discussion of various organizational forms including project functional and matrix organizations Process documents Each of the methods presented in this book also has an associated information system that assists the project team in making decisions and provides documentation By information systems we mean all of the structured means the team uses to exchange information not only the computer systems used by the team For example the concept selection method uses two concept selection matrices to both document and facilitate the selection process Similarly each of the other information systems serves both to facilitate the logical execution of the process step and to document its results Exhibit 18 13 lists some of the important information systems used at the various stages of the development process Assessing Project Status Project leaders and senior managers need to be able to assess project status to know whether corrective actions are warranted In projects of modest size say fewer than 50 people project leaders are fairly easily able to assess the status of the project The project leader assesses project status during formal team meetings by reviewing the project schedule and by gathering information in informal ways The leader constantly interacts with the project team meets regularly with individuals to work through difficult problems and is able to observe all of the information systems of the project A team may also engage an expert from outside the core team to review the status of the project The goal of these reviews is to highlight areas of risk and to generate ideas for addressing these risk areas Project reviews conducted by senior managers are another common method of assessing progress These reviews tend to correspond to the end of each phase of development and are key project milestones These events serve not only to inform senior managers of the status of a project but also to bring closure to a wide variety of development tasks While these reviews can be useful milestones and can enhance project performance they can also hinder performance Detrimental results arise from devoting too much time to preparing formal presentations from delays in scheduling reviews with busy managers and from excessive meddling in the details of the project by those reviewing the project The Critical Chain method uses a novel approach to monitoring the project schedule By simply monitoring the project buffer and the feeder buffers of the project described briefly above the project manager can quickly assess the criticality of each path and the estimated project completion time If tasks consume the project buffer faster than the critical path is being completed the project runs the risk of slipping the end date A buffer report therefore provides a concise update on the project status in terms of progress of the critical path and its feeder paths Corrective Actions After discovering an undesirable deviation from the project plan the team attempts to take corrective action Problems almost always manifest themselves as potential schedule slippage and so most of these corrective actions relate to arresting potential delays Some of the possible actions include Changing the timing or frequency of meetings Sometimes a simple change from weekly to daily meetings increases the driving frequency of the information 1 8 1 3 Information systems that facilitate product development decision making team consensus and the exchange of information Managing Projects 397 Development Activity Information

report among team members and enables more rapid completion of tasks This is particularly true of teams that are not already although if the team is highly dispersed geographically meetings can consume a great deal of travel time Sometimes simply moving a weekly meeting from a Tuesday morning to a Friday afternoon increases the urgency felt by the team to get it done this week Changing the project staff The skills capabilities and commitment of the members of the project team in large measure determine project performance When the project team is grossly understaffed performance can sometimes be increased by adding the necessary staff When the project team is overstaffed performance can sometimes be increased by removing staff Note that adding staff in a panic at the end of a Chapter 18 can lead to delays in project completion because the increased coordination requirements may outweigh the increase in human resources Locating the team together physically If the team is geographically dispersed one way to increase project performance is to locate the team in the same work space This action invariably increases communication among the team members Some benefit of virtual is possible with e mail video conferencing and other collaboration tools Soliciting more time and effort from the team If some team members are distributing their efforts among several projects project performance may be increased by relieving them of other responsibilities Needless to say high performance project teams include team members who regularly deliver more than a 40 hour work week to the project If a few critical tasks demand extraordinary effort most committed teams are willing to devote a few weeks of 14 hour days to get the job done However 60 or 70 hour weeks cannot reasonably be expected from most team members for more than a few weeks without causing fatigue and burnout Focusing more effort on the critical tasks By definition only one sequence of tasks forms the critical path When the path can be usefully attacked by additional people the team may choose to temporarily drop some or all other noncritical tasks in order to ensure timely completion of the critical tasks Engaging outside resources The team may be able to retain an outside resource such as a consulting firm or a supplier to perform some of the development tasks Outside firms are typically fast and relatively economical when a set of tasks can be clearly defined and when coordination requirements are not severe Changing the project scope or schedule If all other efforts fail to correct undesirable deviations from the project plan then the team must narrow the scope of the project identify an alternative project goal or extend slip the project schedule These changes are necessary to maintain a credible and useful project plan Postmortem Project Evaluation An evaluation of the s performance after it has been completed is useful for both personal and organizational improvement This review is often called a postmortem project evaluation or review The postmortem evaluation is usually an open ended discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the project plan development processes employed commercial and technical results and quality of execution This discussion is sometimes facilitated by an outside consultant or by someone within the company who was not involved in the project Several questions help to guide the discussion Did the team achieve the mission articulated in the mission statement including strategic technical and financial goals Which aspects of project performance development time development cost product quality manufacturing cost environmental impacts were most positive Which aspects of project performance were most negative Which tools methods and practices contributed to the positive aspects of performance Managing Projects 399 0 Which tools methods and practices detracted from project success 0 What problems did the team encounter 0 What specific actions can the organization take to improve project performance What specific technical lessons were learned How can they be shared with the rest of the organization A postmortem report is then prepared as part of the formal closing of the project These reports are used in the project planning stage of future projects to help team members know what to expect and to help identify what pitfalls to avoid The reports are also a valuable source of historical data for studies of the firm s product development practices Together with the project documentation and particularly the contract book they provide before and after views of each project For the Cheetah project the postmortem discussion involved six members of the core team and lasted two hours The discussion was facilitated by a consultant The project was completed on time and despite the aggressive schedule so much of the discussion focused on what the team had done to contribute to project success The team agreed that the most important contributors to project success were 0 Empowerment of a team leader 0 Effective team problem solving 0 Emphasis on adherence to schedule 0 Effective communication links 0 Full participation from multiple functions 0 Building on prior experience in cartridge development Use of computer aided design CAD tools for communication and analysis 0 Early understanding of manufacturing capabilities The Cheetah team also identified a few opportunities for improvement 0 Use of three dimensional CAD tools and plastic molding analysis tools 0 Earlier participation by the customer in the design decisions 0 Improved integration of tooling design and production system design Summary Successful product development requires effective project management Some of the key ideas in this chapter are Projects consist of tasks linked to each other by dependencies Tasks can be sequential parallel or coupled The longest chain of dependent tasks defines the critical path which dictates the minimum possible completion time of the project The design structure matrix can be used to represent dependencies charts are used to represent the timing of tasks PERT charts represent both dependencies and timing and are frequently used to compute the critical path 400 Chapter 18 0 Project planning results in a task list a project schedule staffing requirements a project budget and a risk plan These items are key elements of the contract book 0 Most opportunities for accelerating projects arise during the project planning phase There are many ways to complete development projects more quickly Project execution involves coordination assessment of progress and taking action to address deviations from the plan 0 Evaluating the performance of a project

Example One of the most useful applications of the design structure matrix method is to represent well established but complex engineering design processes This rich process modeling approach facilitates 0 Understanding of the existing development process 0 Communication of the process to the people involved Process improvement 0 Visualization of progress during the project Exhibit 18 14 shows a model of a critical portion of the development process at a major automobile manufacturer The model includes 50 tasks involved in the digital mock up process for the layout of all of the many components in the engine compartment of the vehicle The process takes place in six phases depicted by the blocks of activities along the diagonal The first two of these phases project planning and CAD data collection occur in parallel followed by the development of the digital assembly model preparation Each of the last three phases involves successively more accurate analytical verification that components represented by the digital assembly model actually fit properly within the engine compartment area of the vehicle In contrast to the simpler model shown in Exhibit 18 3 where the squares on the diagonal identify sets of coupled activities the in Exhibit 18 14 uses such blocks to show which activities are executed together in parallel sequentially and or iteratively within each phase Arrows and dashed lines represent the major iterations between sets of activities within each phase
