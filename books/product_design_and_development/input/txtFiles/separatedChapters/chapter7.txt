The president of Stanley Bostitch commissioned team to develop new handheld nailer for the roofing market The product that eventually resulted from the effort is shown in Exhibit The mission of the team was to consider broadly alternative product concepts assuming only that the tool would employ conventional nails as the basic fastening technology After identifying set of customer needs and establishing target product specifications the team faced the following questions What existing solution concepts if any could be successfully adapted for this application What new concepts might satisfy the established needs and specifications What methods can be used to facilitate the concept generation process The Activity of Concept Generation product concept is an approximate description of the technology working principles and form of the product It is concise description of how the product will satisfy the customer needs concept is usually expressed as sketch or as rough three dimensional model and is often accompanied by brief textual description The degree to which product satisfies customers and can be successfully commercialized depends to large measure on the quality of the underlying concept good concept is sometimes poorly implemented in subsequent development phases but poor concept can rarely be manipulated to achieve commercial success Fortunately concept generation is relatively inexpensive and can be done relatively quickly in comparison to the rest of the development process For example concept generation had typically consumed less than percent of the budget and 15 percent of the development time in previous nailer development efforts Because the concept generation activity is not costly there is no excuse for lack of diligence and care in executing sound concept generation method The concept generation process begins with set of customer needs and target specifications and results in set of product concepts from which the team will make final selection The relation of concept generation to the other concept development activities is shown in Exhibit In most cases an effective development team will generate hundreds of concepts of which to 20 will merit serious consideration during the concept selection activity Mission Statement Development Identify Establish Generate Select Test Set Plan Plan Customer Target Product Product Product Final Downstream Needs Specifications Concepts Concept Concept Specifications Development Perform Economic Analysis Benchmark Competitive Products Build andTest Models and Prototypes EXHIBIT Concept generation is an integral part of the concept development phase Concept Generation 19 Good concept generation leaves the team with confidence that the full space of alternatives has been explored Thorough exploration of alternatives early in the development process greatly reduces the likelihood that the team will stumble upon superior concept late in the development process or that competitor will introduce product with dramatically better performance than the product under development Structured Approaches Reduce the Likelihood of Costly Problems Common dysfunctions exhibited by development teams during concept generation include Consideration of only one or two alternatives often proposed by the most assertive members of the team Failure to consider carefully the usefulness of concepts employed by other firms in related and unrelated products Involvement of only one or two people in the process resulting in lack of confidence and commitment by the rest of the team Ineffective integration of promising partial solutions Failure to consider entire categories of solutions structured approach to concept generation reduces the incidence of these problems by encouraging the gathering of information from many disparate information sources by guiding the team in the thorough exploration of alternatives and by providing mechanism for integrating partial solutions structured method also provides step by step procedure for those members of the team who may be less experienced in design intensive activities allowing them to participate actively in the process Five Step Method This chapter presents five step concept generation method The method outlined in Exhibit breaks complex problem into simpler subproblems Solution concepts are then identified for the subproblems by external and internal search procedures Classification trees and concept combination tables are then used to systematically explore the space of solution concepts and to integrate the subproblem solutions into total solution Finally the team takes step back to reflect on the validity and applicability of the results as well as on the process used This chapter will follow the recommended method and will describe each of the five steps in detail Although we present the method in linear sequence concept generation is almost always iterative Like our other development methods these steps are intended to be baseline from which product development teams can develop and refine their own unique problem solving style Our presentation of the method is focused primarily on the overall concept for new product however the method can and should be used at several different points in the development process The process is useful not only for overall product concepts but also for concepts for subsystems and specific components as well Also note that while the example in this chapter involves relatively technical product the same basic approach can be applied to nearly any product 20 Chapter EXHIBIT 7Th Clarify the IVC problem step concept generation Understanding method Problem decomposition Focus on critical subproblems Subproblems Search Search externally internally Lead users Individual Experts Group Patents Literature Benchmarking New Concepts Existing Concepts Explore systematically Classification tree Combination table Integrated Solutions Reflect on the solutions and the process Constructive feedback Step Clarify the Problem Clarifying the problem consists of developing general understanding and then breaking the problem down into subproblems if necessary The mission statement for the project the customer needs list and the preliminary product specification are the ideal inputs to the concept generation process although often these pieces of information are still being refined as the concept generation phaseConcept Generation 121 begins Ideally the team has been involved both in the identification of the customer needs and in the setting of the target product specifications Those members of the team who were not involved in these preceding steps should become familiar with the processes used and their results before concept generation activities begin See Chapter Identifying Customer Needs and Chapter Product Specifications As stated before the challenge was to design better handheld roofing nailer The scope of the design problem could have been defined more generally fasten roofing materials or more specifically improve the speed of the existing pneumatic tool concept Some of the assumptions in the team mission statement were The nailer will use nails as opposed to adhesives screws etc The nailer will be compatible with nail magazines on existing tools The nailer will nail through roofing shingles into wood The nailer will be handheld Based on the assumptions the team had identified the customer needs for handheld nailer These included The nailer inserts nails in rapid succession The nailer is lightweight The nailer has no noticeable nailing delay after tripping the tool The team gathered supplemental information to clarify and quantify the needs such as the approximate energy and speed of the nailing These basic needs were subsequently translated into target product specifications The target specifications included the following Nail lengths from 25 millimeters to 38 millimeters Maximum nailing energy of 40 joules per nail Nailing forces of up to 000 newtons Peak nailing rate of one nail per second Average nailing rate of 12 nails per minute Tool mass less than kilograms Maximum trigger delay of 25 second Decompose Complex Problem into Simpler Subproblems Many design challenges are too complex to solve as single problem and can be usefully divided into several simpler subproblems For example the design of complex product like document copier can be thought of as collection of more focused design problems including for example the design of document handler the design of paper feeder the design of printing device and the design of an image capture device In some cases however the design problem cannot readily be divided into subproblems For example the problem of designing paper clip may be hard to divide into subproblems As general rule we feel that teams should attempt to decompose design problems but should be aware that such decomposition may not be very useful for products with extremely simple functions Dividing problem into simpler subproblems is called problem decomposition There are many schemes by which problem can be decomposed Here we demonstrate functional decomposition and also list several other approaches that are frequently useful 122 Chapter Input Output Energy Energy Material nails fined Material driven nail Signal tool trip Signal Energy Nails Trip ofTool Store or Convert accept energy to external translational energy energy Apply Sto_ re lsolalte translational BrIfi en rim naI energy to nail Sense TrIgger trIp tool lb EXHIBIT Function diagram of handheld nailer arising from functional decomposition overall black box refinement showing subfunctions The first step in decomposing problem functionally is to represent it as single black box operating on material energy and signal flows as shown in Exhibit Thin solid lines denote the transfer and conversion of energy thick solid lines signify the movement of material within the system and dashed lines represent the flows of control and feedback signals within the system This black box represents the overall function of the product The next step in functional decomposition is to divide the single black box into subfunctions to create more specific description of what the elements of the product might do in order to implement the overall function of the product Each subfunction can generally be further divided into even simpler subfunctions The division process is repeated until the team members agree that each subfunction is simple enough to work with good rule of thumb is to create between and 10 subfunctions in the diagram The end result shown in Exhibit is function diagram containing subfunctions connected by energy material and signal flows Concept Generation 123 Note that at this stage the goal is to describe the functional elements of the product without implying specific technological working principle for the product concept For example Exhibit includes the subfunction isolate nail This subfunction is expressed in such way that it does not imply any particular physical solution concept such as indexing the coil of nails into slot or breaking nail sideways off of the stick The team should consider each subfunction in turn and ask whether it is expressed in way that does not imply particular physical solution principle There is no single correct way of creating function diagram and no single correct functional decomposition of product helpful way to create the diagram is to quickly create several drafts and then work to refine them into single diagram that the team is comfortable with Some useful techniques for getting started are Create function diagram of an existing product Create function diagram based on an arbitrary product concept already generated by the team or based on known subfunction technology Be sure to generalize the diagram to the appropriate level of abstraction Follow one of the flows material and determine what operations are required The details of the other flows can be derived by thinking about their connections to the initial flow Note that the function diagram is typically not unique In particular subfunctions can often be ordered in different ways to produce different function diagrams Also note that in some applications the material energy and signal flows are difficult to identify In these cases simple list of the subfunctions of the product without connections between them is often sufficient Functional decomposition is most applicable to technical products but it can also be applied to simple and apparently nontechnical products For example an ice cream scoop has material flow of ice cream being separated formed transported and deposited These subfunctions could form the basis of problem decomposition Functional decomposition is only one of several possible ways to divide problem into simpler subproblems Two other approaches are Decomposition by sequence of user actions For example the nailer problem might be broken down into three user actions moving the tool to the gross nailing position positioning the tool precisely and triggering the tool This approach is often useful for products with very simple technical functions involving lot of user interaction Decomposition by key customer needs For the nailer this decomposition might include the following subproblems fires nails in rapid succession is lightweight and has large nail capacity This approach is often useful for products in which form and not working principles or technology is the primary problem Examples of such products include toothbrushes assuming the basic brush concept is retained and storage containers Focus Initial Efforts on the Critical Subproblems The goal of all of these decomposition techniques is to divide complex problem into simpler problems such that these simpler problems can be tackled in focused way Once problem decomposition is complete the team chooses the subproblems that are most critical to the success of the product and that are most likely to benefit from novel or creative1 24 Chapter solutions This approach involves conscious decision to defer the solution of some of the subproblems For example the nailer team chose to focus on the subproblems of storing accepting energy converting the energy to translational energy and applying the translational energy to the nail The team felt confident that the nail handling and triggering issues could be solved after the energy storage and conversion issues were addressed The team also deferred most of the user interaction issues of the tool The team believed that the choice of basic working principle for the tool would so constrain the eventual form of the tool that they had to begin with the core technology and then proceed to consider how to embody that technology in an attractive and user friendly form Teams can usually agree after few minutes of discussion on which subproblems should be addressed first and which should be deferred for later consideration Step Search Externally External search is aimed at finding existing solutions to both the overall problem and the subproblems identified during the problem clarification step While external search is listed as the second step in the concept generation method this sequential labeling is deceptive external search occurs continually throughout the development process Implementing an existing solution is usually quicker and cheaper than developing new solution Liberal use of existing solutions allows the team to focus its creative energy on the critical subproblems for which there are no satisfactory prior solutions Furthermore conventional solution to one subproblem can frequently be combined with novel solution to another subproblem to yield superior overall design For this reason external search includes detailed evaluation not only of directly competitive products but also of technologies used in products with related subfunctions The external search for solutions is essentially an information gathering process Available time and resources can be optimized by using an expand and focus strategy first expand the scope of the search by broadly gathering information that might be related to the problem and then focus the scope of the search by exploring the promising directions in more detail Too much of either approach will make the external search inefficient There are at least five good ways to gather information from external sources lead user interviews expert consultation patent searches literature searches and competitive benchmarking Interview Lead Users While identifying customer needs the team may have sought out or encountered lead users Lead users are those users of product who experience needs months or years before the majority of the market and stand to benefit substantially from product innovation von Hippel 1988 Frequently these lead users will have already invented solutions to meet their needs This is particularly true among highly technical user communities such as those in the medical or scientific fields Lead users may be sought out in the market for which the team is developing the new product or they may be found in markets for products implementing some of the subfunctions of the product In the handheld nailer case the nailer team consulted with the building contractors from the PBS television series This Old House in order to solicit new concepts These lead users who are exposed to tools from many manufacturers made many interestingConcept Generation 125 observations about the weaknesses in existing tools but in this case did not provide many new product concepts Consult Experts Experts with knowledge of one or more of the subproblems not only can provide solution concepts directly but also can redirect the search in more fruitful area Experts may include professionals at firms manufacturing related products professional consultants university faculty and technical representatives of suppliers These people can be found by calling universities by calling companies and by looking up authors of articles While finding experts can be hard work it is almost always less time consuming than re creating existing knowledge Most experts are willing to talk on the telephone or meet in person for an hour or so without charge In general consultants will expect to be paid for time they spend on problem beyond an initial meeting or telephone conversation Suppliers are usually willing to provide several days of effort without direct compensation if they anticipate that someone will use their product as component in design Of course experts at directly competing firms are in most cases unwilling to provide proprietary information about their product designs good habit to develop is to always ask people consulted to suggest others who should be contacted The best information often comes from pursuing these second generation leads The nailer design team consulted dozens of experts including rocket fuel specialist electric motor researchers at MIT and engineers from vendor of gas springs Most of this consultation was done on the telephone although the engineers from the spring vendor made two trips to visit the team at their company expense Search Patents Patents are rich and readily available source of technical information containing detailed drawings and explanations of how many products work The main disadvantage of patent searches is that concepts found in recent patents are protected generally for 20 years from the date of the patent application so there may be royalty involved in using them However patents are also useful to see what concepts are already protected and must be avoided or licensed Concepts contained in foreign patents without global coverage and in expired patents can be used without payment of royalties See Chapter 16 Patents and Intellectual Property for an explanation of patent rights and how to understand patent claims The formal indexing scheme for patents is difficult for novices to navigate Fortunately several databases contain the actual text of all patents These text databases can be searched electronically by key words Key word searches can be conducted efficiently with only modest practice and are remarkably effective in finding patents relevant to particular product Copies of patents including illustrations can be obtained for nominal fee from the Patent and Trademark Office and from several suppliers See the Web site www ulrich eppinger net for current list of online patent databases and suppliers of patent documents patent search in the area of nailers revealed several interesting concepts One of the patents described motor driven double flywheel nailer One of the illustrations from this patent is shown in Exhibit The design in this patent uses the accumulation of rotational kinetic energy in flywheel which is then suddenly converted into translational energy by friction clutch The energy is then delivered to the nail with single impact of drive pin 26 Chapter

is nine pages long Search Published Literature Published literature includes journals conference proceedings trade magazines government reports market consumer and product information and new product announce ments Literature searches are therefore very fertile sources of existing solutions Electronic searches are frequently the most efficient way to gather information from published literature Searching the Internet is often good first step although the quality of the results can be hard to assess More structured databases are available from online sources Many databases store only abstracts of articles and not the full text and diagrams follow up search for an actual article is often needed for complete information The two main difficulties in conducting good database searches are determining the key words and limiting the scope of the search There is trade off between the need to use more key words for complete coverage and the need to restrict the number of matches to manage able number Concept Generation 127 Handbooks cataloging technical information can also be very useful references for external search Examples of such engineering references are Marks Standard Handbook of Mechanical Engineering Perrys Chemical Engineers Handbook and Mechanisms and Mechanical Devices Soarcebook The nailer team found several useful articles related to the subproblems including articles on energy storage describing flywheel and battery technologies In handbook they found an impact tool mechanism that provided useful energy conversion concept Benchmark Related Products In the context of concept generation benchmarking is the study of existing products with functionality similar to that of the product under development or to the subproblems on which the team is focused Benchmarking can reveal existing concepts that have been implemented to solve particular problem as well as information on the strengths and weaknesses of the competition At this point the team will likely already be familiar with the competitive and closely related products Products in other markets but with related functionality are more difficult to find One of the most useful sources of this information is the Thomas Register directory of manufacturers of industrial products organized by product type Often the hardest part of using the Thomas Register is finding out what related products are actually called and how they are cataloged The Thomas Register database can be accessed via the Internet For the nailer the closely related products included single shot gunpowder actuated tool for nailing into concrete an electrical solenoid actuated tacker pneumatic nailer for factory use and palm held multiblow pneumatic nailer The products with related functionality in this case energy storage and conversion included air bags and the sodium azide propellant used as an energy source chemical hand warmers for skiing air rifles powered by carbon dioxide cartridges and portable computers and their battery packs The team obtained and disassembled most of these related products in order to discover the general concepts on which they were based as well as other more detailed information including for example the names of the suppliers of specific components External search is an important method of gathering solution concepts Skill in conducting external searches is therefore valuable personal and organizational asset This ability can be developed through careful observation of the world in order to develop mental database of technologies and through the development of network of professional contacts Even with the aid of personal knowledge and contacts external search remains detective work and is completed most effectively by those who are persistent and resourceful in pursuing leads and opportunities Step Search Internally Internal search is the use of personal and team knowledge and creativity to generate solution concepts Often called brainstorming this type of search is internal in that all of the ideas to emerge from this step are created from knowledge already in the possession of the team This activity may be the most open ended and creative of any task in product development We find it useful to think of internal search as process of retrieving potentially useful piece of information from one memory and then adapting128 Chapter that information to the problem at hand This process can be carried out by individuals working in isolation or by group of people working together Four guidelines are useful for improving both individual and group internal search Suspend judgment In most aspects of daily life success depends on an ability to quickly evaluate set of alternatives and take action For example none of us would be very productive if deciding what to wear in the morning or what to eat for breakfast involved an extensive period of generating alternatives before making judgment Because most decisions in our day to day lives have implications of only few minutes or hours we are accustomed to making decisions quickly and moving on Concept generation for product development is fundamentally different We have to live with the consequences of product concept decisions for years As result suspending evaluation for the days or weeks required to generate large set of alternatives is critical to success The imperative to suspend judgment is frequently translated into the rule that during group concept generation sessions no criticism of concepts is allowed better approach is for individuals perceiving weaknesses in concepts to channel any judgmental tendencies into suggestions for improvements or alternative concepts Generate lot of ideas Most experts believe that the more ideas team generates the more likely the team is to explore fully the solution space Striving for quantity lowers the expectations of quality for any particular idea and therefore may encourage people to share ideas they may otherwise view as not worth mentioning Further each idea acts as stimulus for other ideas so large number of ideas has the potential to stimulate even more ideas Welcome ideas that may seem infeasible Ideas which initially appear infeasible can often be improved debugged or repaired by other members of the team The more infeasible an idea the more it stretches the boundaries of the solution space and encourages the team to think of the limits of possibility Therefore infeasible ideas are quite valuable and their expression should be encouraged Use graphical and physical media Reasoning about physical and geometric information with words is difficult Text and verbal language are inherently inefficient vehicles for describing physical entities Whether working as group or as an individual abundant sketching surfaces should be available Foam clay cardboard and other threedimensional media may also be appropriate aids for problems requiring deep understanding of form and spatial relationships Both Individual and Group Sessions Can Be Useful Formal studies of group and individual problem solving suggest that set of people working alone for period of time will generate more and better concepts than the same people working together for the same time period McGrath 1984 This finding is contrary to the actual practices of the many firms that perform most of their concept generation activities in group sessions Our observations confirm the formal studies and we believe that team members should spend at least some of their concept generation time working alone We also believe that group sessions are critical for building consensus communicating information and refining concepts In an ideal setting each individual on the team would spend several hours working alone and then the group would get together to discuss and improve the concepts generated by individuals Concept Generation 129 However we also know that there is practical reason for holding group concept generation sessions it is one way to guarantee that the individuals in the group will devote certain amount of time to the task Especially in very intense and demanding work environments without scheduling meeting few people will allocate several hours for concentrated individual effort on generating new concepts The phone rings people interrupt urgent problems and mails demand attention In certain environments scheduled group sessions may be the only way to guarantee that enough attention is paid to the concept generation activity The nailer team used both individual effort and group sessions for internal search For example during one particular week each member was assigned one or two subproblems and was expected to develop at least 10 solution concepts This divided the concept generation work among all members The group then met to discuss and expand on the individually generated concepts The more promising concepts were investigated further Hints for Generating Solution Concepts Experienced individuals and teams can usually just sit down and begin generating good concepts for subproblem Often these people have developed set of techniques they use to stimulate their thinking and these techniques have become natural part of their problem solving process Novice product development professionals may be aided by set of hints that stimulate new ideas or encourage relationships among ideas VanGundy 1988 von Oech 1998 and McKim 1980 give dozens of helpful suggestions Here are some hints we have found to be helpful Make analogies Experienced designers always ask themselves what other devices solve related problem Frequently they will ask themselves if there is natural or biological analogy to the problem They will think about whether their problem exists at much larger or smaller dimensional scale than that which they are considering They will ask what devices do something similar in an unrelated area of application The nailer team when posing these questions realized that construction pile drivers are similar to nailers in some respects In following up on this idea they developed the concept of multiblow tool Wish and wonder Beginning thought or comment with wish we could or wonder what would happen if helps to stimulate oneself or the group to consider new possibilities These questions cause reflection on the boundaries of the problem For example member of the nailer team when confronted with the required length of rail gun an electromagnetic device for accelerating projectile for driving nail said wish the tool could be meter long Discussion of this comment led to the idea that perhaps long tool could be used like cane for nailing decking allowing users to remain on their feet Use related stimuli Most individuals can think of new idea when presented with new stimulus Related stimuli are those stimuli generated in the context of the problem at hand For example one way to use related stimuli is for each individual in group session to generate list of ideas working alone and then pass the list to his or her neighbor Upon reflection on someone else ideas most people are able to generate new ideas Other related stimuli include customer needs statements and photographs of the use environment of the product 130 Chapter Use unrelated stimuli Occasionally random or unrelated stimuli can be effective in encouraging new ideas An example of such technique is to choose at random one of collection of photographs of objects and then to think of some way that the randomly generated object might relate to the problem at hand In variant of this idea individuals can be sent out on the streets with digital camera to capture random images for subsequent use in stimulating new ideas This may also serve as good change of pace for tired group Set quantitative goals Generating new ideas can be exhausting Near the end of session individuals and groups may find quantitative goals useful as motivating force The nailer team frequently issued individual concept generation assignments with quantitative targets of 10 to 20 concepts Use the gallery method The gallery method is way to display large number of concepts simultaneously for discussion Sketches usually one concept to sheet are taped or pinned to the walls of the meeting room Team members circulate and look at each concept The creator of the concept may offer explanation and the group subsequently makes suggestions for improving the concept or spontaneously generates related concepts This method is good way to merge individual and group efforts In the 1990s Russian problem solving methodology called TRIZ Russian acronym for theory of inventive problem solving began to be disseminated in Europe and in the United States The methodology is primarily useful in identifying physical working principles to solve technical problems The key idea underlying TRIZ is to identify contradiction that is implicit in problem For example contradiction in the nailer problem might be that increasing power desirable characteristic would also tend to increase weight an undesirable characteristic One of the TRIZ tools is matrix of 39 by 39 characteristics with each cell corresponding to particular conflict between two characteristics In each cell of the matrix up to four physical principles are suggested as ways of resolving the corresponding conflict There are 40 basic principles including for example the periodic action principle replace continuous action with periodic action like an impulse Using TRIZ the nailer team might have arrived at the concept of using repeated smaller impacts to drive the nail The idea of identifying conflict in the design problem and then thinking about ways to resolve the conflict appears to be very useful problem solving heuristic This approach can be useful in generating concepts even without adopting the entire TRIZ methodology Exhibit shows some of the solutions the nailer team generated for the subproblems of storing or accepting energy and delivering translational energy to nail Step Explore Systematically As result of the external and internal search activities the team will have collected tens or hundreds of concept fragments solutions to the subproblems Systematic exploration is aimed at navigating the space of possibilities by organizing and synthesizing these solution fragments The nailer team focused on the energy storage conversion and delivery subproblems and had generated dozens of concept fragments for each subproblem One approach to organizing and synthesizing these fragments would be to consider all of theConcept Generation 131 EXHlelt Solutions to Subproblem 01m teth Solutions to Subproblem of Applying Translational SO rons

cells Push Solar steam conversion Steam supply line Wind 3333 Geothermal Twist push possible combinations of the fragments associated with each subproblem however little arithmetic reveals the impossibility of this approach Given the three subproblems on which the team focused and an average of 15 fragments for each subproblem the team would have to consider 375 combinations of fragments 15 15 15 This would be daunting task for even the most enthusiastic team Furthermore the team would quickly discover that many of the combinations do not even make sense Fortunately there are two specific tools for managing this complexity and organizing the thinking of the team the concept classification tree and the concept combination table The classification tree helps the team divide the possible solutions into independent categories The combination table guides the team in selectively considering combinations of fragments 132 Chapter EXHIBIT classification tree for the nailer energy source concept fragments Fuel Air Systems Chemical Explosive Systems Pneumatic Store or Accept Energy Hydraulic Wall Outlet Battery Electrical Fuel Cell Nuclear Concept Classification Tree The concept classification tree is used to divide the entire space of possible solutions into several distinct classes that will facilitate comparison and pruning An example of tree for the nailer example is shown in Exhibit The branches of this tree correspond to different energy sources The classification tree provides at least four important benefits Pruning of less promising branches If by studying the classification tree the team is able to identify solution approach that does not appear to have much merit then this approach can be pruned and the team can focus its attention on the more promising branches of the tree Pruning branch of the tree requires some evaluation and judgment and should therefore be done carefully but the reality of product development is that there are limited resources and that focusing the available resources on the most promising directions is an important success factor For the nailer team the nuclear energy source was pruned from consideration Although the team had identified some very intriguing nuclear devices for use in powering artificial hearts they felt that these devices would not be economically practical for at least decade and would probably be hampered by regulatory requirements indefinitely EXHIBIT new problem decomposition assuming an electrical energy source and the accumulation of energy in the mechanical domain Concept Generation 133 Electrical Convert Apply Energy Energy Energy to frAcculmulatel Translational APPIiEd t0 Nail Translational rag artlona Energy Energy gy to Nail Identification of independent approaches to the problem Each branch of the tree can be considered different approach to solving the overall problem Some of these approaches may be almost completely independent of each other In these cases the team can cleanly divide its efforts among two or more individuals or task forces When two approaches both look promising this division of effort can reduce the complexity of the concept generation activities It also may engender some healthy competition among the approaches under consideration The nailer team found that both the chemical explosive branch and the electrical branch appeared quite promising They assigned these two approaches to two different subteams and pursued them independently for several weeks Exposure of inappropriate emphasis on certain branches Once the tree is constructed the team is able to reflect quickly on whether the effort applied to each branch has been appropriately allocated The nailer team recognized that they had applied very little effort to thinking about hydraulic energy sources and conversion technologies This recognition guided them to focus on this branch of the tree for few days Refinement of the problem decomposition for particular branch Sometimes problem decomposition can be usefully tailored to particular approach to the problem Consider the branch of the tree corresponding to the electrical energy source Based on additional investigation of the nailing process the team determined that the instantaneous power delivered during the nailing process was about 10 000 watts for few milliseconds and so exceeds the power that is available from wall outlet battery or fuel cell of reasonable size cost and mass They concluded therefore that energy must be accumulated over substantial period of the nailing cycle say 100 milliseconds and then suddenly released to supply the required instantaneous power to drive the nail This quick analysis led the team to add subfunction accumulate translational energy to their function diagram see Exhibit They chose to add the subfunction after the conversion of electrical energy to mechanical energy but briefly considered the possibility of accumulating the energy in the electrical domain with capacitor This kind of refinement of the function diagram is quite common as the team makes more assumptions about the approach and as more information is gathered The classification tree in Exhibit shows the alternative solutions to the energy source subproblem However there are other possible trees The team might have chosen to use tree classifying the alternative solutions to the energy delivery subproblem showing branches for single impact multiple impacts or pushing Trees can be constructed with branches corresponding to the solution fragments of any of the subproblems but certain classifications are more useful In general subproblem whose solution highly constrains the possible solutions to the remaining subproblems is good candidate for classification tree For example the choice of energy source electrical nuclear pneumatic etc constrains whether motor or piston cylinder can be used to convert the energy to translational energy In contrast the choice of energy delivery mechanism single impact 134 Chapter Convert Apply Electrical Energy to Accumulate Translational Translational Energy Energy Energy to Nail Rotary motor with transmission Spring Single impact Linear motor Moving mass Multiple impacts Solenoid Push nail UUU Rail gun EXHIBIT Concept combination table for the handheld nailer multiple impacts etc does not greatly constrain the solutions to the other subproblems Reflection on which subproblem is likely to most highly constrain the solutions to the remaining subproblems will usually lead to one or two clear ways to construct the classification tree Concept Combination Table The concept combination table provides way to consider combinations of solution fragments systematically Exhibit shows an example of combination table that the nailer team used to consider the combinations of fragments for the electrical branch of the classification tree The columns in the table correspond to the subproblems identified in Exhibit The entries in each column correspond to the solution fragments for each of these subproblems derived from external and internal search For example the subproblem of converting electrical energy to translational energy is the heading for the first column The entries in this column are rotary motor with transmission linear motor solenoid and rail gun Potential solutions to the overall problem are formed by combining one fragment from each column For the nailer example there are 24 possible combinations Choosing combination of fragments does not lead spontaneously to solution to the overall problem The combination of fragments must usually be developed and refined before an integrated solution emerges This development may not even be possible or may lead to more than one solution but at minimum it involves additional creative thought In some ways the combination table is simply way to make forced associations among fragments in order to stimulate further creative thinking in no way does the mere act of selecting combination yield complete solution Concept Generation 135 Convert Apply Electrical Energy to Accumulate Translational Translational Energy

potential energy that is then delivered to the nail in single blow Two guidelines make the concept combination process easier First if fragment can be eliminated as being infeasible before combining it with other fragments then the number of combinations the team needs to consider is dramatically reduced For example if the team could determine that the rail gun would not be feasible under any condition they could reduce the number of combinations from 24 to 18 Second the concept combination table should be concentrated on the subproblems that are coupled Coupled subproblems are those whose solutions can be evaluated only in combination with the solutions to other subproblems For example the choice of the specific electrical energy source to be usedConcept Generation 137 Convert Apply

battery versus wall outlet although extremely critical is somewhat independent of the choice of energy conversion motor versus solenoid Therefore the concept combination table does not need to contain column for the different types of electrical energy sources This reduces the number of combinations the team must consider As practical matter concept combination tables lose their usefulness when the number of columns exceeds three or four Managing the Exploration Process The classification tree and combination tables are tools that team can use somewhat flexibly They are simple ways to organize thinking and guide the creative energies of the team Rarely do teams generate only one classification tree and one concept combination table More typically the team will create several alternative classification trees and several138 Chapter Convert Apply Electrical Energy to Accumulate Translational Translational Energy Energy Energy to Nail Rotary motor with rin Sin leim act transmisswn Linear

decomposition or the pursuit of additional internal or external search The exploration step of concept generation usually acts more as guide for further creative thinking than as the final step in the process Recall that at the beginning of the process the team chooses few subproblems on which to focus attention Eventually the team must return to address all of the subproblems This usually occurs after the team has narrowed the range of alternatives for the critical subproblems The nailer team narrowed its alternatives to few chemical and few electric concepts and then refined them by working out the user interface industrial design and configuration issues One of the resulting concept descriptions is shown in Exhibit 14 EXHIBIT One of several refined solution concepts Concept Generation 139 Courtesy of Product Genesis Inc Step Reflect on the Solutions and the Process Although the reflection step is placed here at the end for convenience in presentation reflection should in fact be performed throughout the whole process Questions to ask include Is the team developing confidence that the solution space has been fully explored Are there alternative function diagrams Are there alternative ways to decompose the problem Have external sources been thoroughly pursued Have ideas from everyone been accepted and integrated in the process The nailer team members discussed whether they had focused too much attention on the energy storage and conversion issues in the tool while ignoring the user interface and overall configuration They decided that the energy issues remained at the core of the problem and that their decision to focus on these issues first was justified They also wondered if they had pursued too many branches of the classification tree Initially they had pursued electrical chemical and pneumatic concepts before ultimately settling on an electric concept In hindsight the chemical approach had some obvious safety and customer perception shortcomings they were exploring the use of explosives as an energy source They decided that although they liked some aspects of the chemical solution they should have eliminated it from consideration earlier in the process allowing more time to pursue some of the more promising branches in greater detail 140 Chapter The team explored several of these concepts in more detail and built working prototypes of nailers incorporating two fundamentally different directions motor winding spring with energy released in single blow and motor with rotating mass that repeatedly hit the nail at rate of about 10 cycles per second until the nail was fully driven Ultimately the multiblow tool proved to be the most technically feasible approach and the final product Exhibit was based on this concept Summary product concept is an approximate description of the technology working principles and form of the product The degree to which product satisfies customers and can be successfully commercialized depends to large measure on the quality of the underlying concept The concept generation process begins with set of customer needs and target specifications and results in set of product concepts from which the team will make final selection In most cases an effective development team will generate hundreds of concepts of which to 20 will merit serious consideration during the subsequent concept selection activity The concept generation method presented in this chapter consists of five steps Clarify the problem Understand the problem and decompose it into simpler subproblems Search externally Gather information from lead users experts patents published literature and related products Search internally Use individual and group methods to retrieve and adapt the knowledge of the team Explore systematically Use classification trees and combination tables to organize the thinking of the team and to synthesize solution fragments Reflect on the solutions and the process Identify opportunities for improvement in subsequent iterations or future projects Although concept generation is an inherently creative process teams can benefit from using structured method Such an approach allows full exploration of the design space and reduces the chance of oversight in the types of solution concepts considered It also acts as map for those team members who are less experienced in design problem solving Despite the linear presentation of the concept generation process in this chapter the team will likely return to each step of the process several times Iteration is particularly common when the team is developing radically new product Professionals who are good at concept generation seem to always be in great demand as team members Contrary to popular opinion we believe concept generation is skill that can be learned and developed Concept Generation 141 References and Bibliography Many current resources are available on the Internet via www rich eppinger net Pahl and Beitz
