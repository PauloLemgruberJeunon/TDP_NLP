 1831 84 Chapter 10 product development team within Hewlett Packard home printing division was considering how to respond to the simultaneous pressures to increase product variety and to reduce manufacturing costs Several of the division printer products are shown in Exhibit 10 Ink jet printing had become the dominant technology for consumer and small office printing involving color Excellent black and white print quality and nearphotographic color print quality could be obtained using printer costing less than 200 Driven by the increasing value of color ink jet printers sales of the three leading competitors together were millions of units per year However as the market matured commercial success required that printers be tuned to the subtle needs of more focused market segments and that the manufacturing costs of these products be continually reduced In considering their next steps the team members asked How would the architecture of the product impact their ability to offer product variety What would be the cost implications of different product architectures How would the architecture of the product impact their ability to complete the design within 12 months How would the architecture of the product influence their ability to manage the development process Product architecture is the assignment of the functional elements of product to the physical building blocks of the product We focus this chapter on the task of establishing the product architecture The purpose of the product architecture is to define the basic physical building blocks of the product in terms of what they do and what their interfaces are to the rest of the device Architectural decisions allow the detailed design and testing of these building blocks to be assigned to teams individuals and or suppliers such that development of different portions of the product can be carried out simultaneously In the next two sections of this chapter we define product architecture and illustrate the profound implications of architectural decisions using as examples the HewlettPackard printer and several other products We then present method for establishing the product architecture and focus on the printer example for illustration Note that the details of the printer example have been somewhat disguised to preserve HewlettPackard proprietary product information After presenting the method we discuss the relationships among product architecture product variety and supply chain performance and we provide guidance for platform planning an activity closely linked to the product architecture What Is Product Architecture product can be thought of in both functional and physical terms The functional elements of product are the individual operations and transformations that contribute to the overall performance of the product For printer some of the functional elements are store paper and communicate with host computer Functional elements are usually described in schematic form before they are reduced to specific technologies components or physical working principles The physical elements of product are the parts components and subassemblies that ultimately implement the product functions The physical elements become moreEXHIBIT 10 Two models of bicycle brake and shifting controls The product on the left exemplifies modular architecture the product on the right has more integral architecture Product Architecture 85 defined as development progresses Some physical elements are dictated by the product concept and others become defined during the detail design phase For example the DeskJet embodies product concept involving thermal ink delivery device implemented by print cartridge This physical element is inextricably linked to the product concept and was essentially an assumption of the development project The physical elements of product are typically organized into several major physical building blocks which we call chunks Each chunk is then made up of collection of components that implement the functions of the product The architecture of product is the scheme by which the functional elements of the product are arranged into physical chunks and by which the chunks interact Perhaps the most important characteristic of product architecture is its modularity Consider the two different designs for bicycle braking and shifting controls shown in Exhibit 10 In the traditional design left the shift control function and the brake control function are allocated to separate chunks which in fact are mounted in separate locations on the bicycle This design exhibits modular architecture In the design on the right the shift and brake control functions are allocated to the same chunk This design exhibits an integral architecture in this case motivated by aerodynamic and ergonomic concerns modular architecture has the following two properties Chunks implement one or few functional elements in their entirety The interactions between chunks are well defined and are generally fundamental to the primary functions of the product The most modular architecture is one in which each functional element of the product is implemented by exactly one physical chunk and in which there are few well defined interactions between the chunks Such modular architecture allows design change to be made to one chunk without requiring change to other chunks for the product to function correctly The chunks may also be designed quite independently of one another The opposite of modular architecture is an integral architecture An integral architecture exhibits one or more of the following properties Courtesy of Shimano1 86 Chapter 10 XIII Functional elements of the product are implemented using more than one chunk single chunk implements many functional elements The interactions between chunks are ill defined and may be incidental to the primary functions of the products product embodying an integral architecture will often be designed with the highest possible performance in mind Implementation of functional elements may be distributed across multiple chunks Boundaries between the chunks may be difficult to identify or may be nonexistent Many functional elements may be combined into few physical components to optimize certain dimensions of performance however modifications to any one particular component or feature may require extensive redesign of the product Modularity is relative property of product architecture Products are rarely strictly modular or integral Rather we can say that they exhibit either more or less modularity than comparative product as in the brake and shift controls example in Exhibit 10 Types of Modularity Modular architectures comprise three types slot bus and sectional Ulrich 1995 Each type embodies one to one mapping from functional elements to chunks and welldefined interfaces The differences between these types lie in the way the interactions between chunks are organized Exhibit 10 illustrates the conceptual differences among these types of architectures Slot modular architecture Each of the interfaces between chunks in slot modular architecture is of different type from the others so that the various chunks in the product cannot be interchanged An automobile radio is an example of chunk in slot modular architecture The radio implements exactly one function but its interface is different from any of the other components in the vehicle radios and speedometers have different types of interfaces to the instrument panel Bus modular architecture In bus modular architecture there is common bus to which the other chunks connect via the same type of interface common example of chunk in bus modular architecture would be an expansion card for personal computer Nonelectronic products can also be built around bus modular architecture Track lighting shelving systems with rails and adjustable roof racks for automobiles all embody bus modular architecture Slot Modular Bus Modular Sectional Modular Architecture Architecture Archltecture EXHIBIT Three types of modular architectures Product Architecture 87 Sectional modular architecture In sectional modular architecture all interfaces are of the same type but there is no single element to which all the other chunks attach The assembly is built up by connecting the chunks to each other via identical interfaces Many piping systems adhere to sectional modular architecture as do sectional sofas office partitions and some computer systems Slot modular architectures are the most common of the modular architectures because for most products each chunk requires different interface to accommodate unique interactions between that chunk and the rest of the product Bus modular and sectionalmodular architectures are particularly useful for situations in which the overall product must vary widely in configuration but whose chunks can interact in standard ways with the rest of the product These situations can arise when all of the chunks can use the same type of power fluid connection structural attachment or exchanges of signals When Is the Product Architecture Defined product architecture begins to emerge during concept development This happens informally in the sketches function diagrams and early prototypes of the concept development phase Generally the maturity of the basic product technology dictates whether the product architecture is fully defined during concept development or during system level design When the new product is an incremental improvement on an existing product concept then the product architecture is defined within the product concept This is for two reasons First the basic technologies and working principles of the product are predefined and so conceptual design efforts are generally focused on better ways to embody the given concept Second as product category matures supply chain production and distribution considerations and issues of product variety begin to become more prominent Product architecture is one of the development decisions that most impacts firm ability to efficiently deliver high product variety Architecture therefore becomes central element of the product concept However when the new product is the first of its kind concept development is generally concerned with the basic working principles and technology on which the product will be based In this case the product architecture is often the initial focus of the system level design phase of development Implications of the Architecture Decisions about how to divide the product into chunks and about how much modularity to impose on the architecture are tightly linked to several issues of importance to the entire enterprise product change product variety component standardization product performance manufacturability and product development management The architecture of the product therefore is closely linked to decisions about marketing strategy manufacturing capabilities and product development management Product Change Chunks are the physical building blocks of the product but the architecture of the product defines how these blocks relate to the function of the product The architecture therefore also defines how the product can be changed Modular chunks allow changes to be made to few isolated functional elements of the product without necessarily affecting188 Chapter 10 the design of other chunks Changing an integral chunk may influence many functional elements and require changes to several related chunks Some of the motives for product change are Upgrade As technological capabilities or user needs evolve some products can accommodate this evolution through upgrades Examples include changing the processor board in computer printer or replacing pump in cooling system with more powerful model Add ons Many products are sold by manufacturer as basic unit to which the user adds components often produced by third parties as needed This type of change is common in the personal computer industry third party mass storage devices may be added to basic computer Adaptation Some long lived products may be used in several different use environments requiring adaptation For example machine tools may need to be converted from 220 volt to 110 volt power Some engines can be converted from gasoline to propane fuel supply Wear Physical elements of product may deteriorate with use necessitating replacement of the worn components to extend the useful life of the product For example many razors allow dull blades to be replaced tires on vehicles can usually be replaced most rotational bearings can be replaced and many appliance motors can be replaced Consumption Some products consume materials which can then be easily replenished For example copiers and printers frequently contain print cartridges cameras take film cartridges glue guns consume glue sticks torches have gas cartridges and watches contain batteries all of which are generally replaceable Flexibility in use Some products can be configured by the user to provide different capabilities For example many cameras can be used with different lens and flash options some boats can be used with several awning options and fishing rods may accommodate several rod reel configurations Reuse In creating subsequent products the firm may wish to change only few functional elements while retaining the rest of the product intact For example consumer electronics manufacturers may wish to update product line by changing only the user interface and enclosure while retaining the inner workings from previous model In each of these cases modular architecture allows the firm to minimize the physical changes required to achieve functional change Product Variety Variety refers to the range of product models the firm can produce within particular time period in response to market demand Products built around modular product architectures can be more easily varied without adding tremendous complexity to the manufacturing system For example Swatch produces hundreds of different watch models but can achieve this variety at relatively low cost by assembling the variants from different combinations of standard chunks Exhibit 10 large number of different hands faces and wristbands can be combined with relatively small selection of movements and cases to create seemingly endless combinations EXHIBIT 10 Swatch uses modular architecture to enable high variety manufacturing Product Architecture 89 Photo by Stuart Cohen Component Standardization Component standardization is the use of the same component or chunk in multiple products If chunk implements only one or few widely useful functional elements then the chunk can be standardized and used in several different products Such standardization allows the firm to manufacture the chunk in higher volumes than would otherwise be possible This in turn may lead to lower costs and increased quality For example the watch movement shown in Exhibit 10 is identical for many Swatch models Component standardization may also occur outside the firm when several manufacturers products all use chunk or component from the same supplier For example the watch battery shown in Exhibit 10 is made by supplier and standardized across several manufacturers product lines Product Performance We define product performance as how well product implements its intended functions Typical product performance characteristics are speed efficiency life accuracy and noise An integral architecture facilitates the optimization of holistic performance characteristics and those that are driven by the size shape and mass of product Such characteristics include acceleration energy consumption aerodynamic drag noise and aesthetics Consider for example motorcycle conventional motorcycle architecture assigns the structural support functional element to frame chunk and the power conversion functional element to transmission chunk Exhibit 10 shows photograph of the BMW R1100RS The architecture of this motorcycle assigns both the structural support function and the power conversion function to the transmission chunk This integral architecture allows the motorcycle designers to exploit the secondary structural properties of the transmission casing in order to eliminate the extra size and mass of separate190 Chapter 10 EXHIBIT The BMW Rl 100RS motorcycle This product exhibits function sharing and an integral architecture with the design of its transmission chunk Courtesy of BMW Motorcycle Group frame The practice of implementing multiple fimctions using single physical element is called function sharing An integral architecture allows for redundancy to be eliminated through function sharing as in the case of the motorcycle and allows for geometric nesting of components to minimize the volume product occupies Such function sharing and nesting also allow material use to be minimized potentially reducing the cost of manufacturing the product Manufacturability In addition to the cost implications of product variety and component standardization described above the product architecture also directly affects the ability of the team to design each chunk to be produced at low cost One important design for manufacturing DFM strategy involves the minimization of the number of parts in product through component integration However to maintain given architecture the integration ofProduct Architecture 91 physical components can only be easily considered within each of the chunks Component integration across several chunks is difficult if not impossible and would alter the architecture dramatically Because the product architecture constrains subsequent detail design decisions in this way the team must consider the manufacturing implications of the architecture For this reason DFM begins during the system level design phase while the layout of the chunks is being planned For details about the implementation of DFM see Chapter 13 Design for Manufacturing Product Development Management Responsibility for the detail design of each chunk is usually assigned to relatively small group within the firm or to an outside supplier Chunks are assigned to single individual or group because their design requires careful resolution of interactions geometric and otherwise among components within the chunk With modular architecture the group assigned to design chunk deals with known and relatively limited functional interactions with other chunks If functional element is implemented by two or more chunks as in some integral architectures detail design will require close coordination among different groups This coordination is likely to be substantially more involved and challenging than the limited coordination required among groups designing different chunks in modular design For this reason teams relying on outside suppliers or on geographically dispersed team often opt for modular architecture in which development responsibilities can be split according to the chunk boundaries Another possibility is to have several functional elements allocated to the same chunk In this case the work of the group assigned to that chunk involves great deal of internal coordination across larger group Modular and integral architectures also demand different project management styles Modular approaches require very careful planning during the system level design phase but detail design is largely concerned with ensuring that the teams assigned to chunks are meeting the performance cost and schedule requirements for their chunks An integral architecture may require less planning and specification during system level design but such an architecture requires substantially more integration conflict resolution and coordination during the detail design phase Establishing the Architecture Because the product architecture will have profound implications for subsequent product development activities and for the manufacturing and marketing of the completed product it should be established in cross functional effort by the development team The end result of this activity is an approximate geometric layout of the product descriptions of the major chunks and documentation of the key interactions among the chunks We recommend four step method to structure the decision process which is illustrated using the DeskJet printer example The steps are Create schematic of the product Cluster the elements of the schematic Create rough geometric layout Identify the fundamental and incidental interactions 192 Chapter 10 Enclose Printer Print Provide Structural Support Position Cartridge in Axis Position Paper in Axis Pick Paper Communicate Command flow of forces or energy liq Lt Printer flow of material flow of signals ordata Connect to Host EXHIBIT Schematic of the DeskJet printer Note the presence of both functional elements Store Output and physical elements Print Cartridge For clarity not all connections among elements are shown Step Create Schematic of the Product schematic is diagram representing the team understanding of the constituent elements of the product schematic for the DeskJet is shown in Exhibit 10 At the end of the concept development phase some of the elements in the schematic are physical concepts such as the front in front out paper path Some of the elements correspond to critical components such as the print cartridge the team expects to use However some of the elements remain described only functionally These are the functional elements of the product that have not yet been reduced to physical concepts or components For example display status is functional element required for the printer but the particular approach of the display has not yet been decided Those elements that have been reduced to physical concepts or components are usually central to the basic product concept the team has generated and selected Those elements that remain unspecified in physical terms are usually ancillary functions of the product The schematic should reflect the team best understanding of the state of the product but it does not have to contain every imaginable detail such as sense out of paperProduct Architecture 93 condition or shield radio frequency emissions These and other more detailed functional elements are deferred to later step good rule of thumb is to aim for fewer than 30 elements in the schematic for the purpose of establishing the product architecture If the product is complex system involving hundreds of functional elements then it is useful to omit some of the minor ones and to group some others into higher level functions to be decomposed later See Defining Secondary Systems later in this chapter The schematic created will not be unique The specific choices made in creating the schematic such as the choice of functional elements and their arrangement partly define the product architecture For example the functional element control printer is represented as single centralized element in Exhibit 10 An alternative would be to distribute the control of each of the other elements of the product throughout the system and have coordination done by the host computer Because there is usually substantial latitude in the schematic the team should generate several alternatives and select an approach that will facilitate the consideration of several architectural options Step Cluster the Elements of the Schematic The challenge of step is to assign each of the elements of the schematic to chunk One possible assignment of elements to chunks is shown in Exhibit 10 where nine chunks are used Although this was the approximate approach taken by the DeskJet team there are several other viable alternatives At one extreme each element could be assigned to its own chunk yielding 15 chunks At the other extreme the team could decide that the product would have only one major chunk and then attempt to physically integrate all of the elements of the product In fact consideration of all possible clusterings of elements would yield thousands of alternatives One procedure for managing the complexity of the alternatives is to begin with the assumption that each element of the schematic will be assigned to its own chunk and then to successively cluster elements where advantageous To determine when there are advantages to clustering consider these factors which echo the implications discussed in the previous section Geometric integration and precision Assigning elements to the same chunk allows single individual or group to control the physical relationships among the elements Elements requiring precise location or close geometric integration can often be best designed if they are part of the same chunk For the DeskJet printer this would suggest clustering the elements associated with positioning the cartridge in the axis and positioning the paper in the axis Function sharing When single physical component can implement several functional elements of the product these functional elements are best clustered together This is the situation exemplified by the BMW motorcycle transmission Exhibit 10 For the DeskJet printer the team believed that the status display and the user controls could be incorporated into the same component and so clustered these two elements together Capabilities of vendors trusted vendor may have specific capabilities related to project and in order to best take advantage of such capabilities team may choose to cluster those elements about which the vendor has expertise into one chunk In the case of the DeskJet printer an internal team did the majority of the engineering design work and so this was not major consideration 194 Chapter 10 Enclosure Enclose Printer Provide Structural Support Position Cartridge Chassis in Axis Print Cartridge User Interface Board Position Paper in Axis Power Cord and Brick Pick Paper PaperTray Print Mechanism Communicate Command wrth Printer Host Host Driver Software Connect to Host Logic Board EXHIBIT Clustering the elements into chunks Nine chunks make up this proposed architecture for the De skJet printer Similarity of design or production technology When two or more functional elements are likely to be implemented using the same design and or production technology then incorporating these elements into the same chunk may allow for more economical design and or production common strategy for example is to combine all functions that are likely to involve electronics in the same chunk This allows the possibility of implementing all of these functions with single circuit board Localization of change When team anticipates great deal of change in some element it makes sense to isolate that element into its own modular chunk so that required changes to the element can be carried out without disrupting any of the other chunks The Hewlett Packard team anticipated changing the physical appearance of the product over its life cycle and so chose to isolate the enclosure element into its own chunk Accommodating variety Elements should be clustered together to enable the firm to vary the product in ways that will have value for customers The printer was to be soldEXHIBIT 10 Geometric layout of the printer Product Architecture 95 fl User Interface Board Enclosure _U Print Cartridge Roller Guide Pa er Paper Tray Logic Board Chassis around the world in regions with different electrical power standards As result the team created separate chunk for the element associated with supplying DC power Enabling standardization If set of elements will be useful in other products they should be clustered together into single chunk This allows the physical elements of the chunk to be produced in higher quantities Hewlett Packard internal standardization was key motive for using an existing print cartridge and so this element is preserved as its own chunk Portability of the interfaces Some interactions are easily transmitted over large distances For example electrical signals are much more portable than are mechanical forces and motions As result elements with electronic interactions can be easily separated from one another This is also true but to lesser extent for fluid connections The flexibility of electrical interactions allowed the Hewlett Packard team to cluster the control and communication functions into the same chunk Conversely the elements related to paper handling are much more geometrically constrained by their necessary mechanical interactions Step Create Rough Geometric Layout geometric layout can be created in two or three dimensions using drawings computer models or physical models of cardboard or foam for example Exhibit 10 shows geometric layout of the DeskJet printer positioning the major chunks Creating geometric layout forces the team to consider whether the geometric interfaces among the chunks are feasible and to work out the basic dimensional relationships among the196 Chapter 10 EXHIBIT Incidental interaction graph chunks By considering cross section of the printer the team realized that there was fundamental trade off between how much paper could be stored in the paper tray and the height of the machine In this step as in the previous step the team benefits from generating several alternative layouts and selecting the best one Layout decision criteria are closely related to the clustering issues in step In some cases the team may discover that the clustering derived in step is not geometrically feasible and thus some of the elements would have to be reassigned to other chunks Creating the rough layout should be coordinated with the industrial designers on the team in cases where the aesthetic and human interface issues of the product are important and strongly related to the geometric arrangement of the chunks Step Identify the Fundamental and Incidental Interactions Most likely different person or group will be assigned to design each chunk Because the chunks interact with one another in both planned and unintended ways these different groups will have to coordinate their activities and exchange information In order to better manage this coordination process the team should identify the known interactions between chunks during the system level design phase There are two categories of interactions between chunks First fundamental interactions are those corresponding to the lines on the schematic that connect the chunks to one another For example sheet of paper flows from the paper tray to the print mechanism This interaction is planned and it should be well understood even from the very earliest schematic as it is fundamental to the system operation Second incidental interactions are those that arise because of the particular physical implementation of functional elements or because of the geometric arrangement of the chunks For example vibrations induced by the actuators in the paper tray could interfere with the precise location of the print cartridge in the axis While the fundamental interactions are explicitly represented by the schematic showing the clustering of elements into chunks the incidental interactions must be documented in some other way For small number of interacting chunks fewer than about 10 an interaction graph is convenient way to represent the incidental interactions Exhibit 10 shows possible interaction graph for the DeskJet printer representing the known incidental interactions For larger systems this type of graph becomes confusing Enclosure Userlnterface Board Styling Thermal ralon Prlnt Distortlon Host Drlver Pa erTra Mechanism L09 Board Software Thermal Distortion RF Interference RF Shielding Power Cord Chassis and Brick Product Architecture 97 and an interaction matrix is useful instead and can be used to display both fundamental and incidental interactions See Eppinger 1997 for an example of using such matrix which is also used to cluster the functional elements into chunks based on quantification of their interactions The interaction graph in Exhibit 10 suggests that vibration and thermal distortion are incidental interactions among the chunks that create heat and involve positioning motions These interactions represent challenges in the development of the system requiring focused coordination efforts within the team We can use the mapping of the interactions between the chunks to provide guidance for structuring and managing the remaining development activities Chunks with important interactions should be designed by groups with strong communication and coordination between them Conversely chunks with little interaction can be designed by groups with less coordination Eppinger 1997 describes matrix based method for prescribing such system level coordination needs in larger projects It is also possible through careful advance coordination to develop two interacting chunks in completely independent fashion This is facilitated when the interactions between the two chunks can be reduced in advance to completely specified interface that will be implemented by both chunks It is relatively straightforward to specify interfaces to handle the fundamental interactions while it can be difficult to do so for incidental interactions Knowledge of the incidental interactions and sometimes of the fundamental interactions as well develops as system level and detail design progress The schematic and the interaction graph or matrix can be used for documenting this information as it evolves The network of interactions among subsystems modules and components is sometimes called the system architecture Delayed Differentiation When firm offers several variants of product the product architecture is key determinant of the performance of the supply chain the sequence of production and distribution activities that links raw materials and components to finished products in the hands of customers Imagine three different versions of the printer each adapted to different electrical power standard in three different geographic regions Consider at what point along the supply chain the product is uniquely defined as one of these three variants Assume that the supply chain consists of three basic activities assembly transportation and packaging Exhibit 10 10 illustrates how the number of distinct variants of the product evolves as the product moves through the supply chain In scenario the three versions of the printer are defined during assembly then transported and finally packaged In scenario the assembly activity is divided into two stages most of the product is assembled in the first stage the product is then transported assembly is completed and finally the product is packaged In scenario the components associated with power conversion are assembled after transportation and so the product is not differentiated until near the end of the supply chain Postponing the differentiation of product until late in the supply chain is called delayed differentiation or simply postponement and may offer substantial reductions198 Chapter 10 Scenario Early Differentiation fl iv QQAK Assembly Differentiation Transport Inventory of Three Models fi emflee Scenario Postponement Transport Inventory of One Subassembly Partial Assembly Delayed Differentiation EXHIBIT Postponement involves delaying differentiation of the product until late in the supply chain In scenario three versions of the product are created during assembly and before transportation In scenario the three versions of the product are not created until after transportation Product Architecture 99 in the costs of operating the supply chain primarily through reductions in inventory requirements For most products and especially for innovative products demand for each version of product is unpredictable That is there is component of demand that varies randomly from one time period to the next To offer consistently high product availability in the presence of such demand uncertainty requires that inventory be held somewhere near the end of the supply chain To understand why this is so imagine McDonald restaurant trying to respond to minute to minute fluctuations in demand for french fries if it peeled cut and fried potatoes only after an order was placed Instead it maintains an inventory of cooked french fries that can be quickly scooped into package and delivered For printers transportation by ship between production and distribution sites may require several weeks So to be responsive to fluctuations in demand substantial inventories must be held after transportation The amount of inventory required for given target level of availability is function of the magnitude of the variability in demand Postponement enables substantial reductions in the cost of inventories because there is substantially less randomness in the demand for the basic elements of the product the platform than there is for the differentiating components of the variants of the product This is because in most cases demand for different versions of product is somewhat uncorrelated so that when demand for one version is high it is possible that demand for some other version of the product will be low Two design principles are necessary conditions for postponement The differentiating elements of the product must be concentrated in one or few chunks In order to differentiate the product through one or few simple process steps the differentiating attributes of the product must be defined by one or few components of the product Consider the case of the different electrical power requirements for printers in different geographical regions If the differences between product adapted for 120VAC power in the United States and 220VAC power in Europe were associated with several components distributed throughout the product power cord power switch transformer rectifier etc all in different chunks there would be no way to delay differentiation of the product without also delaying the assembly of these several chunks See Exhibit 10 11 top If however the only difference between these two models is single chunk containing cord and power supply brick then the difference between the two IE EXHIBIT To enable postponement the differentiating attributes of the product must be concentrated in one or few chunks In the top case the power supply is distributed across the cord enclosure chassis and logic board In the bottom case the power supply is confined to the cord and power supply brick 200 Chapter 10 versions of the product requires differences in only one chunk and one assembly operation See Exhibit 10 11 bottom The product and production process must be designed so that the differentiating chunk can be added to the product near the end of the supply chain Even if the differentiating attributes of the product correspond to single chunk postponement may not be possible This is because the constraints of the assembly process or product design may require that this chunk be assembled early in the supply chain For example one could envision the consumer packaging of the printer the printed carton being primary differentiating chunk because of different language requirements for different markets If transporting the product from the factory to the distribution center required that the printer be assembled into its carton then it would be impossible to postpone the differentiation of the product with respect to packaging type To avoid this problem Hewlett Packard devised clever packaging scheme in which molded trays are used to position several dozen bare assembled printers on each of several layers of large shipping pallet which can then be wrapped with plastic film and loaded directly into shipping container This approach allows differentiation of the carton to occur after the printers have been transported to the distribution center and the appropriate power supply installed Platform Planning Hewlett Packard provides DeskJet products to customers with different needs For illustrative purposes think of these customers as belonging to three market segments family student and small ofi ice home oflice SOHO To serve these customers Hewlett Packard could develop three entirely different products it could offer only one product to all three segments or it could differentiate these products through differences in only subset of the printer components See Chapter Product Planning for discussion of related decisions desirable property of the product architecture is that it enables company to offer two or more products that are highly differentiated yet share substantial fraction of their components The collection of assets including component designs shared by these products is called product platform Planning the product platform involves managing basic trade off between distinctiveness and commonality On the one hand there are market benefits to offering several very distinctive versions of product On the other hand there are design and manufacturing benefits to maximizing the extent to which these different products share common components Two simple information systems allow the team to manage this trade off the differentiation plan and the commonality plan Differentiation Plan The differentiation plan explicitly represents the ways in which multiple versions of product will be different from the perspective of the customer and the market Exhibit 10 12 shows an example differentiation plan The plan consists of matrix with rows for the differentiating attributes of the printer and with columns for the different versions or models of the product By differentiating attributes we mean those characteristics of the product that are important to the customer and that are intended to be different across the products Differentiating attributes are generally expressed in the language ofProduct Architecture 201 Differentiating Attributes Family

in Chapter Product Specifications The team uses the differentiation plan to codify its decisions about how the products will be different Unconstrained the differentiation plan would exactly match the preferences of the customers in the market segments targeted by each different product Unfortunately such plans generally imply products that are prohibitively costly Commonality Plan The commonality plan explicitly represents the ways in which the different versions of the product are the same physically Exhibit 10 13 shows commonality plan for the printer example The plan consists of matrix with rows representing the chunks of the product The third fourth and fifth columns correspond to the three different versions of the product The second column indicates the number of different types of each chunk that are implied by the plan The team fills each cell in the remaining columns with label for each different version of chunk that will be used to make up the product Unconstrained most manufacturing engineers would probably choose to use only one version of each chunk in all variants of the product Unfortunately this strategy would result in products that are undifferentiated 202 Chapter 10 Managing the Trade Off between Differentiation and Commonality The challenge in platform planning is to resolve the tension between the desire to differentiate the products and the desire for these products to share substantial fraction of their components Examination of the differentiation plan and the commonality plan reveals several trade offs For example the student printer has the potential to offer the benefit of small footprint which is likely to be important to space conscious college students However this differentiating attribute implies that the student printer would require different print mechanism chunk which is likely to add substantially to the investment required to design and produce the printer This tension between desire to tailor the benefits of product to the target market segment and the desire to minimize investment is highlighted when the team attempts to make the differentiation plan and the commonality plan consistent We offer several guidelines for managing this tension Platform planning decisions should be informed by quantitative estimates of cost and revenue implications Estimating the profit contribution from one percentagepoint increase in market share is useful benchmark against which to measure the potential increase in manufacturing and supply chain costs of additional versions of chunk In estimating supply chain costs the team must consider the extent to which the differentiation implied by the differentiation plan can be postponed or whether it must be created early in the supply chain Iteration is beneficial In our experience teams make better decisions when they make several iterations based on approximate information than when they agonize over the details during relatively fewer iterations The product architecture dictates the nature of the trade off between differentiation and commonality The nature of the trade off between differentiation and commonality is not fixed Generally modular architectures enable higher proportion of components to be shared than integral architectures This implies that when confronted with seemingly intractable conflict between differentiation and commonality the team should consider alternative architectural approaches which may provide opportunities to enhance both differentiation and commonality For the printer example the tension between differentiation and commonality might be resolved by compromise The revenue benefits of slightly narrower student printer are not likely to exceed the costs associated with creating an entirely different and narrower print mechanism The costs of different print mechanisms are likely to be especially high given that the print mechanism involves substantial tooling investments Also because the print mechanism is created early in the supply chain postponement of differentiation would be substantially less feasible if it required different print mechanisms For these reasons the team would most likely choose to use single common print mechanism and forgo the possible revenue benefits of narrower footprint for the student printer Related System Level Design Issues The four step method for establishing the product architecture guides the early systemlevel design activities but many more detailed activities remain Here we discuss some ofEXHIBIT Specification of interface between black print cartridge and logic board Product Architecture 203 the issues that frequently arise during subsequent system level design activities and their implications for the product architecture Defining Secondary Systems The schematic in Exhibit 10 shows only the key elements of the product There are many other functional and physical elements not shown some of which will only be conceived and detailed as the system level design evolves These additional elements make up the secondary systems of the product Examples include safety systems power systems status monitors and structural supports Some of these systems such as safety systems will span several chunks Fortunately secondary systems usually involve flexible connections such as wiring and tubing and can be considered after the major architectural decisions have been made Secondary systems cutting across the boundaries of chunks present special management challenge Should single group or individual be assigned to design secondary system even though the system will be made up of components residing in several different chunks Or should the group or individuals responsible for the chunks be responsible for coordinating among themselves to ensure that the secondary systems will work as needed The former approach is more typical where specific individuals or subteams are assigned to focus on the secondary systems Establishing the Architecture of the Chunks Some of the chunks of complex product may be very complex systems in their own right For example many of the chunks in the DeskJet printer involve dozens of parts Each of these chunks may have its own architecture the scheme by which it is divided into smaller chunks This problem is essentially identical to the architectural challenge posed at the level of the entire product Careful consideration of the architecture of the chunks is nearly as important as the creation of the architecture of the overall product For example the print cartridge consists of the subfunctions store ink and deliver ink for each of four colors of ink Several architectural approaches are possible for this chunk including for example the use of independently replaceable reservoirs for each ink color Line Name Properties PWR 12VDC 5mA PWR 5VDC lOmA Black Logic STAT Print Board Cartridge LVL lOOKQ MQ PRNT1 11 PRNTZ PRNT3 PRNT4 PRNT5 PRNTé GND OOONO POON 204 Chapter 10 Creating Detailed Interface Specifications As the system level design progresses the fundamental interactions indicated by lines on the schematic in Exhibit 10 are specified as much more detailed collections of signals material flows and exchanges of energy As this refinement occurs the specification of the interfaces between chunks should also be clarified For example Exhibit 10 14 shows an overview of possible specification of an interface between black print cartridge and logic board for printer Such interfaces represent the contracts between chunks and are often detailed in formal specification documents Summary Product architecture is the scheme by which the functional elements of the product are arranged into physical chunks The architecture of the product is established during the concept development and system level design phases of development Product architecture decisions have far reaching implications affecting such things as product change product variety component standardization product performance manufacturability and product development management key characteristic of product architecture is the degree to which it is modular or integral Modular architectures are those in which each physical chunk implements specific set of functional elements and has well defined interactions with the other chunks There are three types of modular architectures slot modular bus modular and sectional modular Integral architectures are those in which the implementation of functional elements is spread across chunks resulting in ill defined interactions between the chunks We recommend four step method for establishing the product architecture Create schematic of the product Cluster the elements of the schematic Create rough geometric layout Identify the fundamental and incidental interactions This method leads the team through the preliminary architectural decisions Subsequent system level and detail design activities will contribute to continuing evolution of the architectural details The product architecture can enable postponement the delayed differentiation of the product which offers substantial potential cost savings Architectural choices are closely linked to platform planning the balancing of differentiation and commonality when addressing different market segments with different versions of product Due to the broad implications of architectural decisions inputs from marketing manufacturing and design are essential in this aspect of product development Product

Shown clockwise from top left are the MicroTAC 1989 StarTAC 993 V60 2001 and RAZR 2004 models Courtesy of Motorola Inc Industrial Design208 Chapter In 2003 Motorola launched product development effort to augment its very successful but aging lines of flip style or clamshell mobile telephones with an exciting new product The StarTAC and series platforms had each seen several generations of products released since the early 1990s eventually including models for every major worldwide market and standard The RAZR design emerged from product vision to be thin to win considerably thinner than other mobile telephones on the market and striking in its iconic new form This design required new architecture entirely distinct from the existing product platforms Upon its introduction in 2004 customers judged the ultra thin RAZR design shown in Exhibit 11 to be just as radical as its Motorola flip phone predecessors when they were released Sales to early adopters came quickly after successful market introduction in which Hollywood celebrities were shown with the product Surpassing Motorola expectations RAZR sales reached millions of units within one year of launch This success can be attributed to several factors Small size and weight With its slimmer form factor the RAZR was more pocketable than other mobile phone models The RAZR had thickness of 14 millimeters and weight of 95 grams making it the thinnest and one of the lightest mobile phones on the market at the time Performance features The RAZR featured an integrated VGA camera large backlit keypad and large bright color display for new video and graphic applications Instead of headset jack the RAZR utilized Bluetooth networking for wireless headset accessories Superior signal reception and transmission were achieved with novel layout in which the phone antenna was positioned below the keypad and away from the user fingers which can block weak signals Superior ergonomics The RAZR sleek ergonomic design complemented the human face The shape of the handset particularly the angled position of the display with respect to the keypad section conformed to the user for superior comfort The spacing and position of the buttons on the keypad were based on accepted standards and extensive testing allowed for fast and accurate dialing The folding design allowed the user to answer or end calls by opening or closing the phone with one hand aided by recess between the two sections of the clamshell New software for navigation and new shortcuts for entering text facilitated use of text messaging and other applications Durability As with all Motorola products the RAZR was designed to meet rigorous specifications It could be dropped from height of more than meter onto cement floor or sat upon in the open position without sustaining any damage The RAZR could also withstand temperature extremes humidity shock dust and vibration Materials The RAZR utilized several advanced materials to enhance both performance and appearance These included laser cut keypad with laser etched patterns magnesium hinge ultra thin anodized aluminum housing polycarbonate composite antenna housing and chemically annealed glass with thin film coating Appearance The sleek design and metallic finishes gave the RAZR futuristic look associated with innovation Because of its aesthetic appeal and highly recognizable appearance the RAZR quickly became somewhat of status symbol for early adopters and created strong feelings of pride among owners Industrial Design 209 The RAZR development team included electrical mechanical materials software and manufacturing engineers whose contributions were instrumental in developing the technologies and manufacturing processes that allowed the product to achieve its form factor performance and weight However without the contributions of industrial designers who defined the size shape and human factors the RAZR would never have taken its innovative ultra thin form In fact the Motorola team could easily have developed just another phone smaller and lighter than the previous flip phone models Instead revolutionary concept generated by the industrial designers on the team turned the project into dramatic success Industrial designers are primarily responsible for the aspects of product that relate to the user experience the product aesthetic appeal how it looks sounds feels smells and its functional interfaces how it is used For many manufacturers industrial design has historically been an afterthought Managers used industrial designers to style or gift wrap product after its technical features were determined Companies would then market the product on the merits of its technology alone even though customers certainly evaluate product using more holistic judgments including ergonomics and style Today product core technology is generally not enough to ensure commercial success The globalization of markets has resulted in the design and manufacture of wide array of consumer products Fierce competition makes it unlikely that company will enjoy sustainable competitive advantage through technology alone Accordingly companies such as Motorola are increasingly using industrial design as an important tool for both satisfying customer needs and differentiating their products from those of their competition This chapter introduces engineers and managers to industrial design ID and explains how the ID process takes place in relation to other product development activities We refer to the RAZR example throughout this chapter to explain critical ideas Specifically this chapter presents historical perspective on ID and working definition of ID Statistics on typical investments in ID method for determining the importance of ID to particular product The costs and benefits of investing in ID How ID helps to establish corporation identity Specific steps industrial designers follow while designing product description of how the ID process changes according to product type method for assessing the quality of the ID effort for completed product What Is Industrial Design The birth of ID is often traced to western Europe in the early 1900s See Lorenz 1986 for an account of the history of ID which is summarized here Several German companies including AEG large electrical manufacturer commissioned multitude of craftspeople and architects to design various products for manufacture Initially these early European designers had little direct impact on industry however their work resulted in lasting theories that influenced and shaped what is today known as industrial design 210 Chapter 11 Early European approaches to ID such as the Bauhaus movement went beyond mere functionalism they emphasized the importance of geometry precision simplicity and economy in the design of products In short early European designers believed that product should be designed from the inside out Form should follow function In the United States however early concepts of ID were distinctly different While early European industrial designers were architects and engineers most industrial designers in America were actually theater designers and artist illustrators Not surprisingly ID in the United States was often at the service of sales and advertising where product exterior was all important and its insides mattered little Pioneers in US industrial design including Walter Dorwin Teague Norman Bel Geddes and Raymond Loewy emphasized streamlining in product design This trend is best evidenced in US products of the 1930s From fountain pens to baby buggies products were designed with nonfunctional aerodynamic shapes in an attempt to create product appeal The auto industry provides another example The shapes of European automobiles of the 1950s were fairly simple and smooth while US cars of the same era were decorated with such nonfunctional features as tailfins and chrome teeth By the 1970s however European design had strongly influenced American ID largely through the works of Henry Dreyfuss and Eliot Noyes Heightened competition in the marketplace forced companies to search for ways to improve and differentiate their products Increasingly companies accepted the notion that the role of ID needed to go beyond mere shape and appearance Success stories such as Bell Deere Ford and IBM all of which effectively integrated ID into their product development process helped further this thinking By 2000 industrial design became widely practiced in the United States by professionals in many diverse settings ranging from small design consulting firms to in house design offices within large manufacturing companies Motorola industrial designers comprise department titled consumer experience design and participate fully in all new product development efforts The Industrial Designers Society of America IDSA defines industrial design as the professional service of creating and developing concepts and specifications that optimize the function value and appearance of products and systems for the mutual benefit of both user and manufacturer This definition is broad enough to include the activities of the entire product development team In fact industrial designers focus their attention upon the form and user interaction of products Dreyfuss 1967 lists five critical goals that industrial designers can help team to achieve when developing new products Utility The product human interfaces should be safe easy to use and intuitive Each feature should be shaped so that it communicates its function to the user Appearance Form line proportion and color are used to integrate the product into pleasing whole Ease of maintenance Products must also be designed to communicate how they are to be maintained and repaired Low costs Form and features have large impact on tooling and production costs so these must be considered jointly by the team Communication Product designs should communicate the corporate design philosophy and mission through the visual qualities of the products Industrial Design 21 Industrial designers are typically educated in four year university programs where they study sculpture and form develop drawing presentation and model making skills and gain basic understanding of materials manufacturing techniques and finishes In industrial practice designers receive additional exposure to basic engineering advanced manufacturing fabrication processes and common marketing practices Their ability to express ideas visually can facilitate the process of concept development for the team Industrial designers may create most of the concept sketches models and renderings used by the team throughout the development process even though the ideas come from the entire team Assessing the Need for Industrial Design To assess the importance of ID to particular product we first review some investment statistics and then define the dimensions of product that are dependent upon good ID Expenditures for Industrial Design Exhibit 11 shows approximate values of investment in ID for variety of products Both the total expenditures on ID and the percentage of the product development budget invested in ID are shown for consumer and industrial products spanning various industries These statistics should give design teams rough idea of how much ID investment will be required for new product The exhibit shows that the range of expenditures on ID is tremendous For products with relatively little user interaction such as some types of industrial equipment the cost of ID is only in the tens of thousands of dollars On the other hand the development of an intensely visual and interactive product such as an automobile requires millions of dollars of ID effort The relative cost of ID as fraction of the overall development budget also shows wide range For technically sophisticated product such as new aircraft the ID cost can be insignificant relative to the engineering and other development expenditures This does not suggest however that ID is unimportant for such products it suggests only that the other development functions are more costly Certainly the success of new automobile design is highly dependent on its aesthetic appeal and the quality of the user interfaces two dimensions largely determined by ID yet the ID expense of 10 million is modest relative to the entire development budget How Important ls Industrial Design to Product Most products on the market can be improved in some way or another by good ID All products that are used operated or seen by people depend critically on ID for commercial success With this in mind convenient means for assessing the importance of ID to particular product is to characterize importance along two dimensions ergonomics and aesthetics Note that we use the term ergonomics to encompass all aspects of product that relate to its human interfaces The more important each dimension is to the product success the more dependent the product is on ID Therefore by answering series of questions along each dimension we can qualitatively assess the importance of ID 212 Chapter 11 30 Percentage of Product Development Budget Spent on Industrial Design 20 10 EXHIBIT Handheld Medical Instrument Handheld Vacuum Desktop Computer Peripheral Large Scale Medical Handheld OEqu pmem QMobiIe Phone Power Tool Medlcal Imaging Equipment Industrial Food Automobile Jumbo Jet Processing Equipment 10 100 000 10 000 100 000 Total Expenditures on Industrial Design Thousands Industrial design expenditures for some consumer and industrial products Ergonomic Needs How important is ease of use Ease of use may be extremely important both for frequently used products such as an office photocopier and for infrequently used products such as fire extinguisher Ease of use is more challenging if the product has multiple features and or modes of operation that may confuse or frustrate the user When ease of use is an important criterion industrial designers will need to ensure that the features of the product effectively communicate their function How important is ease of maintenance If the product needs to be serviced or repaired frequently then ease of maintenance is crucial For example user should be able to clear paper jam in printer or photocopier easily Again it is critical that the features of the product communicate maintenance repair procedures to the user However in many cases more desirable solution is to eliminate the need for maintenance entirely How many user interactions are required for the product functions In general the more interactions users have with the product the more the product will depend on ID For example doorknob typically requires only one interaction whereas laptop computer may require dozen or more all of which the industrial designer must understand in depth Furthermore each interaction may require different design approach and or additional research Industrial Design 21 How novel are the user interaction needs user interface requiring incremental improvements to an existing design will be relatively straightforward to design such as the buttons on new desktop computer mouse more novel user interface may require substantial research and feasibility studies such as the click wheel on the early Apple iPod music player What are the safety issues All products have safety considerations For some products these can present significant challenges to the design team For example the safety concerns in the design of child toy are much more prominent than those for new computer mouse Aesthetic Needs Is visual product differentiation required Products with stable markets and technology are highly dependent upon ID to create aesthetic appeal and hence visual differentiation In contrast product such as computer internal disk drive which is differentiated by its technological performance is less dependent on ID How important are pride of ownership image and fashion customer perception of product is in part based upon its aesthetic appeal An attractive product may be associated with high fashion and image and will likely create strong sense of pride among its owners This may similarly be true for product that looks and feels rugged or conservative When such characteristics are important ID will play critical role in determining the product ultimate success Will an aesthetic product motivate the team product that is aesthetically appealing can generate sense of team pride among the design and manufacturing staff Team pride helps motivate and unify everyone associated with the project An early ID concept gives the team concrete vision of the end result of the development effort To demonstrate this method we can use the above questions to assess the importance of industrial design in the development of the Motorola RAZR phone Exhibit 11 displays the results of such analysis We find that both ergonomics and aesthetics were extremely important for the RAZR Accordingly ID did indeed play large role in determining many of the product critical success factors The Impact of Industrial Design The previous section focused primarily upon the importance of ID in satisfying customer needs Next we explore both the direct economic impact of investing in ID as well as its impact on corporate identity ls Industrial Design Worth the Investment Managers will ofien want to know for specific product or for business operation in general how much effort should be invested in industrial design While it is difficult to answer this question precisely we can offer several insights by considering the costs and benefits The costs of ID include direct cost manufacturing cost and time cost described next 214 Chapter 11 Needs Level of Importance Explanation of Rating Low Medium High Ergonomics Ease of use Critical for mobile telephone because it may be used frequently may be needed in emergency situations and can be operated by motorists while driving The product function must be communicated through its design Ease of maintenance As with many integrated electronics products there is very little maintenance required There are many important user interactions such as entering text dialing and storing numbers sending and receiving calls taking photos Internet access Quantity of user interactions Novelty of user interactions Design solutions associated with some of the customer interactions were straightforward such as the numeric keypad because there is wealth of human factors data that dictate the basic dimensions However other interfaces such as the one handed operation of such thin phone were quite different from earlier models and therefore required careful study Safety There were few safety issues for ID to consider on the RAZR itself However because many customers use mobile telephones in automobiles line of Bluetooth wireless accessories needed to be designed for safe convenient hands free operation Aesthetics Th Product differentiation ere were un re so mo es of mobile phones on the market when the RAZR was introduced Its appearance was essential for differentiation Pride Of ownership fashion The RAZR was intended to be highly or Image visible product used by people for business and personal communication in public areas It had to be stunningly attractive in everyday use Team motivation The RAZR novel form turned out to be an important inspiration to the development team and selling point for senior management EXHIBIT Assessing the importance of industrial design for Motorola RAZR mobile phone Industrial Design 21 Direct cost is the cost of the ID services This quantity is determined by the number and type of designers used duration of the project and number of models required plus material costs and other related expenses In 2011 ID consulting services in the United States cost 75 to 300 per hour with most of the work being done by juniorlevel designers in the lower half of this price range and senior designers contributing relatively few hours of more strategic work in the higher half of the range Additional charges include costs for models photos and other expenses The true cost of internal corporate design services is generally about the same Manufacturing cost is the expense incurred to implement the product details created through ID Surface finishes stylized shapes rich colors and many other design details can increase tooling cost and or production cost Note however that many ID details can be implemented at practically no cost particularly if ID is involved early enough in the process see below In fact some ID inputs can actually reduce manufacturing costs particularly when the industrial designer works closely with the manufacturing engineers Time cost is the penalty associated with extended lead time As industrial designers attempt to refine the ergonomics and aesthetics of product multiple design iterations and or prototypes will be necessary This may result in delay in the product introduction which will likely have an economic cost The benefits of using ID include increased product appeal and greater customer satisfaction through additional or better features strong brand identity and product differentiation These benefits usually translate into price premium and or increased market share as compared to marketing the product without the ID efforts These costs and benefits of ID were estimated as part of study conducted at MIT that assessed the impact of detail design decisions on product success factors for set of competing products in the market automatic drip coffeemakers Although the relation is difficult to quantify precisely this study found significant correlation between product aesthetics as rated by practicing industrial designers and the retail price for each product but no correlation between aesthetics and manufacturing cost The researchers could not conclude whether the manufacturers had priced their products optimally and could not determine unequivocally if aesthetics of the products enabled manufacturers to garner higher prices However the study suggests that an increase in price of per unit for typical sales volumes would be worth several million dollars in profits over the life of these products Industrial designers asked to price design services for such products gave range from 75 000 to 250 000 suggesting that if ID could add even one dollar worth of perceived benefit to the consumer it would pay back handsomely Pearson 1992 second study conducted at the Open University in England also suggests that investing in ID yields positive return This study tracked the commercial impact of investing in engineering and ID for 221 design projects at small and medium sized manufacturing firms The study found that investing in industrial design consultants led to profits in over 90 percent of all implemented projects and when comparisons were possible with previous less ID oriented products sales increased by an average of 41 percent Roy and Potter 1993 More recent studies have assessed ID effectiveness and the integration of ID into the product development process and found positive correlations between these ID measures and corporate financial performance Gemser and Leenders 2001 Hertenstein et al 2005 216 Chapter 11 For specific project decision performing simple calculations and sensitivity analyses can help quantify the likely economic returns from ID For example if investing in ID will likely result in price premium of 10 per unit what will be the net economic benefit when summed over the original market sales projections Similarly if investing in ID will likely result in greater demand for the product by say 000 units per year what will be the net economic benefit when summed at the original unit price The rough estimates of these benefits can be compared to the expected cost of the ID effort Spreadsheet models are commonly used for this kind of financial decision making and can easily be applied to estimate the expected payback of ID for project Chapter 17 Product Development Economics describes method for developing such financial model How Does Industrial Design Establish Corporate Identity Corporate identity is derived from the visual style of an organization factor that affects the firm positioning in the market Olins 1989 company identity emerges primarily through what people see Advertising logos signage uniforms buildings packaging and product designs all contribute to creating corporate identity In product based companies ID plays an important role in determining the company identity Industrial design determines product style which is directly related to the public perception of the firm When company products maintain consistent and recognizable appearance visual equity is established consistent look and feel may be associated with the product color form style or even its features When firm enjoys positive reputation such visual equity is valuable as it can create positive association with quality for future products Some companies that have effectively used ID to establish visual equity and corporate identity through their product lines include Apple Inc The original Macintosh had small upright shape and benign buff coloring This design purposely gave the product nonthreatening user friendly look that has since been associated with all of Apple products More recent Apple designs have striking lines and innovative styling in silver black and white finishes Rolex Watch Co The Rolex line of watches maintains classic look and solid feel that signifies quality and prestige Braun GmbH Braun kitchen appliances and shavers have clean lines and basic colors The Braun name has long been associated with simplicity and quality Bang Olufis en high fidelity consumer electronics systems are designed to have sleek lines and impressive visual displays providing an image of technological innovation BM WAG BMW automobiles known for luxury features and driver oriented performance display exterior styling features that have evolved slowly retaining the equity associated with the brand Motorola Inc The original MicroTAC and StarTAC mobile phones were recognized as Motorola leading edge flip phone innovations The later RAZR model also used folding clamshell concept in much thinner form factor emphasizing Motorola leadership in rapidly evolving industry Industrial Design 21 The Industrial Design Process Many large companies have internal industrial design departments Small companies tend to use contract ID services provided by consulting firms In either case industrial designers should participate fully on cross functional product development teams Within these teams engineers will generally follow process to generate and evaluate concepts for the technical features of product In similar manner most industrial designers follow process for designing the aesthetics and ergonomics of product Although this approach may vary depending on the firm and the nature of the project industrial designers also generate multiple concepts and then work with engineers to narrow these options down through series of evaluation steps Specifically the ID process can be thought of as consisting of the following phases Investigation of customer needs Conceptualization Preliminary refinement Further refinement and final concept selection Control drawings or models 9MPPPJ Coordination with engineering manufacturing and external vendors This section discusses each of these phases in order and the following section will discuss the timing of these phases within the overall product development process Investigation of Customer Needs The product development team begins by documenting customer needs as described in Chapter Identifying Customer Needs Because industrial designers are skilled at recognizing issues involving user interactions ID involvement is crucial in the needs process For example in researching customer needs for new medical instrument the team would study an operating room interview physicians and conduct focus groups While involvement of marketing engineering and ID certainly leads to common comprehensive understanding of customer needs for the whole team it particularly allows the industrial designer to gain an intimate understanding of the interactions between the user and the product Unlike many development efforts the RAZR project did not rely heavily upon focus groups or formal market research Motorola believed that the high level of secrecy surrounding the project and the difficulty in gaining customer input for next generation products made these techniques impractical Instead the team used extensive input from Motorola employees to understand the evolution of user needs Marketing personnel stressed the importance of Motorola leadership in form factor and style Engineering supplied information on technical limitations involving materials and geometry of components Motorola research on consumer perceptions of quality in mobile phones revealed that while light weight was desirable the phone density was also critical resulting in target specification for overall density Conceptualization Once the customer needs and constraints are understood the industrial designers help the team conceptualize the product During the concept generation stage engineers naturally218 Chapter 11 focus their attention upon finding solutions to the technical subfunctions of the product See Chapter Concept Generation At this time the industrial designers concentrate upon creating the product form and user interfaces Industrial designers make simple sketches known as thumbnail sketches of each concept These sketches are fast and inexpensive medium for expressing ideas and evaluating possibilities Exhibit 11 shows two such sketches from the RAZR project The proposed concepts may then be matched and combined with the technical solutions under exploration Concepts are grouped and evaluated by the team according to the customer needs technical feasibility cost and manufacturing considerations See Chapter Concept Selection It is unfortunate that in some companies industrial designers work quite independently from engineering When this happens ID is likely to propose concepts involving strictly form and style and there are usually numerous iterations when engineering finds the concepts technically infeasible Firms have therefore found it beneficial to tightly coordinate the efforts of industrial designers and engineers throughout the concept development phase so that these iterations can be accomplished more quickly even in sketch form Preliminary Refinement In the preliminary refinement phase industrial designers build models of the most promising concepts Soft models are typically made in full scale using foam or foam core board They are the second fastest method only slightly slower than sketches used to evaluate concepts Although generally quite rough these models are invaluable because they allow the development team to express and visualize product concepts in three dimensions Concepts are evaluated by industrial designers engineers marketing personnel and at times potential customers through the process of touching feeling and modifying the models Typically designers will build as many models as possible depending on time and financial constraints Concepts that are particularly difficult to visualize require more models than do simpler ones The RAZR industrial designers used numerous soft models to assess the overall size proportion and shape of many proposed concepts Of particular concern was the feel of the product in the hand and against the face These attributes can only be assessed using physical models soft model from the RAZR project made using rapid prototyping technology is shown in Exhibit 11 Further Refinement and Final Concept Selection At this stage industrial designers often switch from soft models and sketches to hard models and information intensive drawings known as renderings Renderings show the details of the design and often depict the product in use Drawn in two or three dimensions they convey great deal of information about the product Renderings are often used for color studies and for testing customers reception to the proposed product features and functionality rendering from the RAZR project is shown in Exhibit 11 The final refinement step before selecting concept is to create hard models These models are still technically nonfunctional yet are close replicas of the final design with very realistic look and feel They are made from wood dense foam plastic or metal are painted and textured and have some working features such as buttons that push orEXHIBIT Two quick thumbnail concept sketches left and more detailed

Courtesy of Motorola Inc sliders that move Because hard model can cost thousands of dollars product development team usually has the budget to make only few For many types of products hard models are fabricated to have the intended size density weight distribution surface finish and color Hard models can then be used by industrial designers and engineers to further refine the final concept specifications Furthermore these models can also be used to gain additional customer feedback in focus groups to advertise and promote the product at trade shows and to sell the concept to senior management within an organization Exhibit 11 shows one of the several hard models built during the RAZR development process Extensive usability testing was begun with the RAZR hard models Tests identified the need for larger keypad buttons on thinner phone Designers also realized the need to locate the volume control buttons on the side of the display housing for easier Courtesy of Motorola Inc 220 Chapter fi l__ access when open rather than on the side of the keypad housing They also found that this location required reversal of the functionality of these buttons when the flip is opened Control Drawings or Models Industrial designers complete their development process by making control drawings or control models of the final concept Control drawings or models document functionality features sizes colors surface finishes and key dimensions Although they are not detailed part drawings known as engineering drawings they can be used to fabricate final design models and other prototypes Typically these drawings or models are given to the engineering team for detailed design of the parts Exhibit 11 shows one view of the control model of the final RAZR design Coordination with Engineering Manufacturing and External Vendors The industrial designers must continue to work closely with engineering and manufacturing personnel throughout the subsequent product development process Some industrial design consulting firms offer quite comprehensive product development services including detailed engineering design and the selection and management of outside vendors of materials tooling components and assembly services The Impact of Computer Based Tools on the ID Process Since the 1990s computer aided design CAD tools have had significant impact on industrial designers and their work Using modern 3D CAD tools industrial designers can generate display and rapidly modify three dimensional designs on high resolution computer displays In this manner ID can potentially generate greater number of detailed concepts more quickly which may lead to more innovative design solutions The visual realism of 3D CAD images can enhance communication within the product development team and eliminate much of the inaccuracy of the manually generated sketches historically provided by industrial designers Cardaci 1992 Furthermore 3D CAD systems may be used to generate control models or drawings and these data can be directly transferred to engineering design systems allowing the entire development process to be more easily integrated Exhibit 11 shows 3D CAD model of the RAZR EXHIBIT WWII lF Ei IIHI wlntunuun Courtesy of Motorola Inc Side view of the RAZR control model defining the final RAZR shape and dimensions Industrial Design 221 Courtesy of Motorola Inc EXHIBIT 3D CAD concept image created using Pro ENGINEER software Management of the Industrial Design Process Industrial design is typically involved in the overall product development process during several different phases The timing of the ID effort depends upon the nature of the product being designed To explain the timing of the ID effort it is convenient to classify products as technology driven products and user driven products Technology driven products The primary characteristic of technology driven product is that its core benefit is based on its technology or its ability to accomplish specific technical task While such product may have important aesthetic or ergonomic requirements consumers will most likely purchase the product primarily for its technical performance For example hard disk drive for computer is largely technology driven It follows that for the development team of technology driven product the engineering or technical requirements will be paramount and will dominate development efforts Accordingly the role of ID is often limited to packaging the core technology This entails determining the product external appearance and ensuring
