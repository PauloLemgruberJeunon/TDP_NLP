331332 Chapter 16 David Coffin an individual inventor developed product concept and prototype for an insulating sleeve that would make hot beverage cup more comfortable to hold Exhibit 16 The product opportunity arose in the 1980s after many food vendors had abandoned polystyrene foam hot beverage cups in favor of paper cups The inventor was interested in commercialization and or licensing his invention and sought protection of the intellectual property that he had created This chapter provides an overview of intellectual property in the context of product development and provides specific guidance for preparing an invention disclosure or provisional patent application Within the context of product development the term intellectual property refers to the legally protectable ideas concepts names designs and processes associated with new product Intellectual property can be one of the most valuable assets of firms Unlike physical property intellectual property cannot be secured with lock and key to prevent its unwanted transfer Therefore legal mechanisms have been developed to protect the rights of intellectual property owners These mechanisms are intended to provide an incentive and reward to those who create new useful inventions while at the same time encouraging the dissemination of information for the long run benefit of society What Is Intellectual Property Four types of intellectual property are relevant to product design and development Exhibit 16 presents taxonomy of types of intellectual property Although some areas overlap and all four types of intellectual property may be present in single product particular invention usually falls into one of these categories Patent patent is temporary monopoly granted by government to an inventor to exclude others from using an invention In the United States patent expires 20 years from the filing date Most of the balance of this chapter focuses on patents Trademark trademark is an exclusive right granted by government to trademark owner to use specific name or symbol in association with class of products or services In the context of product development trademarks are typically brands or product names For example JavaJacket is trademark for an insulated cup holder and companies other than Java Jacket Inc may not make unauthorized use of the word JavaJacket to refer to their own cup holder products In the United States registration of trademark is possible but not strictly necessary to preserve the trademark rights In most other countries the rights of trademark are gained through registration Trade secret trade secret is information used in trade or business that offers its owner competitive advantage and that can be kept secret trade secret is not right conferred by government but is the result of vigilance on the part of an organization in preventing the dissemination of its proprietary information Perhaps the most famous trade secret is the formula for the beverage Coca Cola Copyright copyright is an exclusive right granted by government to copy and distribute an original work of expression whether literature graphics music art entertainment or software Registration of copyright is possible but not necessary copyright comes into being upon the first tangible expression of the work and lasts for up to 95 years Patents and Intellectual Property 333 Intellectual Property Patents Utility Design Plant Trade Patents Patents Patents Trademarks Copyright Secret Product Design rl Development Fig 10 Useful Ornamental New Word or Original Proprietary Novel Design Only Plant Symbol Work of and Useful Nonobvious Expression may be registered but requires formal application not necessary not registered EXHIBIT Taxonomy of types of intellectual property relevant to product design and development This chapter focuses on patents Appendix to this chapter briefly discusses trademarks We do not devote substantial attention here to copyrights and trade secrets but several references to other resources appear at the end of the chapter Overview of Patents For most engineered goods two basic types of patents are relevant design patents and utility patents third type of patent covers plants Design patents provide the legal right to exclude someone from producing and selling product with the identical ornamental design described by the design patent design patent can be thought of as copyright for the ornamental design of product Because design patents must be limited to ornamental design for most engineered goods design patents are of very limited value For this reason the chapter focuses further on utility patents Patent law in most of the world evolved from English law and so patent laws in different countries are somewhat similar This chapter uses US law as reference point and so readers with intentions to obtain patents in other countries should carefully investigate the laws in those countries 334 Chapter 16 Utility Patents United States law allows for patenting of an invention that relates to new process machine article of manufacture composition of matter or new and useful improvement of one of these things Fortunately these categories include almost all inventions embodied by new products Note that inventions embodied in software are sometimes patented but usually the invention is described as process or machine Exhibit 16 shows the first page of patent for the insulating sleeve invented by Coffin In addition the law requires that patented inventions be Useful The patented invention must be useful to someone in some context Novel Novel inventions are those that are not known publicly and therefore are not evident in existing products publications or prior patents The definition of novelty relates to disclosures of the actual invention to be patented as well In the United States an invention to be patented must not have been revealed to the public more than year before the patent is filed Nonobvious Patent law defines obvious inventions as those that would be clearly evident to those with ordinary skill in the art who faced the same problem as the inventor Usefulness is rarely hurdle to obtaining patent However the requirements that an invention be novel and nonobvious are the most common barriers to obtaining patent About two thirds of applications filed for patents result in issued patents However an issued patent is not necessarily valid patent may be challenged in government court by competitor at some point in the future The validity of patent is determined by among other factors the adequacy of the description in the patent and the novelty of the invention relative to the prior art tiny fraction of patents few hundred per year in the United States are ever challenged in court Of those challenged in recent years just over half have been found to be valid An inventor associated with patent is person who actually created the invention individually or in collaboration with other inventors In some cases the inventor is also the owner of the intellectual property However in most cases the patent is assigned to some other entity usually the inventors employer The actual intellectual property rights associated with patent belong to the owner of the patent and not necessarily to the inventor Appendix to this chapter provides some advice to individual inventors interested in commercializing their inventions patent owner has the right to exclude others from using making selling or importing an infringing product This is an oflensive right which requires that the patent owner sue the infringer There are also defensive rights associated with patents Any invention described in patent whether part of the claimed invention or not is considered by the legal system to be known publicly and forms part of the prior art This disclosure is defensive act blocking competitor from patenting the disclosed invention Preparing Disclosure This chapter is focused on process for preparing an invention disclosure in essence detailed description of an invention This disclosure will be in the form of patent application which can serve as provisional patent application and with relatively little additional work could be regular patent application It is possible even typical for patentPatents and Intellectual Property 335 U5005205473A

Lochner ABSTRACT Corrugated beverage containers and holders are which employ recyclable materials but provide fluting structures for containing insulating air These products are easy to hold and have lesser impact on the environment than polystyrene containers 57 18 Claims Drawing Sheets336 Chapter 16 attorney to do much of the work described in the chapter However our belief is that having the inventor draft detailed disclosure is the best way to communicate the inventor knowledge even though in most cases patent attorney will revise the disclosure to prepare the formal patent application Although many readers will be able to complete provisional patent application from the guidance provided here this chapter is not substitute for competent legal advice Inventors pursuing serious commercial opportunities should consult with patent attorney after preparing their disclosure The steps in the process are Formulate strategy and plan Study prior inventions Outline claims Write the description of the invention Refine claims Pursue application N9M WNE Reflect on the results and the process Step Formulate Strategy and Plan In formulating patent strategy and plan product development team must decide on the timing of the filing of patent application the type of application to be filed and the scope of the application Timing of Patent Applications Legally patent application must be filed within one year of the first public disclosure of an invention In much of the rest of the world patent must be filed before any public disclosure or within one year of filing application so long as the application is filed before public disclosure In most cases public disclosure is description of the invention to an individual or group of people who are not obligated to keep the invention confidential Examples of such disclosure include publication of invention details in magazine or journal presentation of product at trade show display of the invention on publicly accessible Web site or test marketing of product Most experts agree that student class presentation of an invention is not public disclosure as long as the class members have agreed to preserve the confidentiality of the invention and as long as members of the general public are not present We strongly recommend that inventors file patent applications before any public disclosure This action ensures that the option to file an international patent is preserved for one year Fortunately provisional patent application may be filed at relatively little expense to preserve these rights Although we recommend that filing precede public disclosure the inventor usually benefits by delaying the application until just before such disclosure The principal advantage to waiting as long as possible is that the inventor has as much knowledge as possible about the invention and its commercialization Very often what the inventor believes are the key features of an invention early in the innovation process turn out to be less important than refinements developed later in the innovation process By waiting the inventor can ensure that the most important elements of the invention are captured in the patent application Patents and Intellectual Property 337 The US patent system grants priority among competing patent applications based on the date of invention whereas the patent systems in much of the rest of the world grant priority based on the date of the patent application Therefore in the United States inventors should carefully document the date of their inventions This is best done by describing an invention in bound notebook and then having witness sign and date each page Type of Application team faces two basic choices about the type of patent application to be pursued First the team must decide whether to file regular patent application or provisional patent application Second the team must decide whether to pursue domestic and or foreign patents regular patent application was the only option available to an inventor in the United States until substantial changes were made to patent law in 1995 Under current US patent law an inventor may file provisional patent application provisional patent application needs only to fully describe the invention It does not need to contain claims or comply with the formal structure and language of regular patent application The principal advantage of provisional patent application is that it requires less cost and effort to prepare and file than regular patent application but it preserves all options to pursue further patent filings for period of one year Once provisional patent application has been filed company may label its products patent pending and it retains the right to file foreign patent application and or regular patent application The only fundamental disadvantage of provisional patent application is that it delays the eventual issuance of patent by up to one year as the process of examining patent application does not begin until regular patent application is filed Another possible disadvantage is that the preliminary nature of provisional patent application may lead to the use of less care in preparing the description of the invention than might be the case with regular application The description of the invention must be complete in provisional patent application and the regular patent application that follows cannot contain features that were not described in the provisional application Filing patents internationally is expensive and somewhat complex The team should therefore consult with patent professional about international patent strategy as patent law varies somewhat from country to country To obtain foreign patent rights an application must eventually be filed in each country in which patent is sought The European Community however acts as single entity with respect to patent filing Foreign applications can be expensive costing up to 15 000 per country for filing fees translation fees and patent agent fees The expense of filing for foreign patents can be delayed generally by 30 months by filing Patent Cooperation Treaty PCT application PCT application is filed in one country the United States but is designated as PCT application which is the beginning of process by which foreign patents can be pursued PCT application costs only slightly more than regular patent application in filing fees but it allows for substantial delay before application fees must be paid in the countries in which foreign patents are sought The provisional patent application and the PCT application together provide vehicle for small company or individual inventor to preserve most patent rights with relatively little cost typical strategy is to file provisional patent application before any public disclosure of the invention then within one year to file PCT application with the US patent office then when forced to act or abandon the application at some point in the338 Chapter 16 future usually year or more away to pursue actual foreign applications This strategy allows delay of two or more years before substantial legal and application fees must be paid During this period the team can assess the true commercial potential of the products embodying the invention and can estimate the value of more extensive patent protection Scope of Application The team should evaluate the overall product design and decide which elements embody inventions that are likely to be patentable Typically the process of reviewing the product design will result in list of elements that the team considers to be novel and nonobvious The team should focus on those elements that present substantial barriers to competition which are typically the elements that in the opinion of the team represent substantial improvement over the publicly known methods of addressing similar problems Complex products often embody several inventions For example printer may embody novel signal processing methods and novel paper handling techniques Sometimes these inventions fall into very different classes within the patent system As result product development team may need to file multiple applications corresponding to the distinct classes of invention For simple products or for products that embody single type of invention single patent application usually suffices The decision about whether to divide an application into multiple parts is complex and is best made in consultation with patent attorney However all intellectual property rights are preserved even if patent application is filed that contains multiple classes of inventions In such cases the patent office will inform the inventor that the application must be divided While defining the scope of the patent the team should also consider who the inventors are An inventor is person who contributed substantially to the creation of the invention The definition of an inventor for the purposes of patent law is subjective For example technician who only ran experiments would not typically be an inventor but technician who ran experiments and then devised solution to an observed problem with the device could be considered an inventor There is no limit to the number of inventors named in patent application We believe that product development and invention are most often team efforts and that many members of the team who participated in concept generation and the subsequent design activities could be considered inventors Failing to name person who is an inventor can result in patent being declared not valid Step Study Prior Inventions There are three key reasons for studying prior inventions the so called prior art First by studying the prior patent literature design teams can learn whether an invention may infringe on existing unexpired patents Although there is no legal barrier to patenting an invention that infringes on an existing patent if anyone manufactures sells or uses product that infringes upon an existing patent without license the patent owner may sue for damages Second by studying the prior art the inventors get sense of how similar their invention is to prior inventions and therefore how likely they are to be granted broad patent Third the team will develop background knowledge enabling the members to craft novel claims In the course of product development efforts most teams accumulate variety of references to prior inventions Some of the sources of information on prior inventions include Patents and Intellectual Property 339 Existing and historical product literature Patent searches Technical and trade publications Several good online reference sources can be used for searching patents Simple keyword searches are often sufficient to find most relevant patents It is important for the team to keep file containing the prior art they are aware of This information must be provided to the patent office shortly after filing the patent application In the Coffin patent for the cup holder shown in Exhibit 16 references to 19 other US patents are cited along with reference to book The references cited by the inventor and by the patent examiner are listed on the first page of patent The first page of the Coffin patent is reproduced as Exhibit 16 Among the prior art for the Coffin patent for example is 1930 patent by Benson 771 765 Waterproof Paper Receptacle in which corrugated holder insulates paper liner cup The Benson patent describes cup holder that fits underneath and into the bottom of the liner cup This is one reason that the invention in the Coffin patent is described as tube with an opening at the top and bottom Step Outline Claims Issuance of patent gives the owner legal right to exclude others from infringing on the invention specifically described in the patent claims Claims describe certain characteristics of the invention they are written in formal legal language and must adhere to some rules of composition In step we describe how the formal legal language works However at this point in the process of preparing the disclosure the team benefits from thinking carefully about what it believes is unique about the invention We therefore recommend that the team outline the claims Don worry about legal precision at this point Instead make list of the features and characteristics of the invention that the team believes are unique and valuable For example an outline of the claims for the Coffin invention might be Use of corrugations as insulation in many possible forms Corrugations on the inside surface of the tube Corrugations on the outside surface of the tube Corrugations sandwiched between two flat layers of sheet material Vertical orientation of flutes Flutes open at top and bottom of holder Corrugations with triangle wave cross section Corrugations with sine wave cross section Tubular form with openings at both ends In shape of truncated cone Recyclable materials Recyclable adhesive Recyclable sheeting Cellulose material340 Chapter 16 Biodegradable adhesive Surface to print on Holder folds flat along two fold lines The outline of the claims provides guidance about what must be described in detail in the description Step Write the Description of the Invention The bulk of patent application is formally known as the Specification To avoid confusion with our use of the word Specifications in this book we call the body of the patent application the description because this is the part of the application that actually describes the invention The description must present the invention in enough detail that someone with ordinary skill in the art someone with the skills and capabilities of typical practitioner working in the same basic field as the invention could implement the invention The description should also be marketing document promoting the value of the invention and the weaknesses in existing solutions The patent application will be read by patent examiner who will search and study prior patents The description must convince the examiner that the inventors developed something useful that is different from existing inventions and that is nonobvious In these respects one can think of the description as essentially technical report on the invention There are some formatting conventions for patent applications although these are not strictly necessary for an invention disclosure or provisional patent application Patent law requires that the application teach with sufficient detail that someone skilled in the art could practice the invention For example in the Coffin patent the inventor discloses that the adhesive to bond the flutes is recyclable and preferably biodegradable adhesive for example R130 adhesive by Fasson Inc Grand Rapids MI The requirement to completely teach the invention may be somewhat counterintuitive for someone accustomed to treating inventions confidentially Patent law requires that inventors disclose what they know about the invention but in exchange they are granted the right to exclude others from practicing the invention for limited time period This requirement reflects the basic tension in the patent system between granting temporary monopoly to inventors in exchange for publication of information that will eventually be available for use by anyone typical description includes the following elements Title Provide short descriptive label for the invention for example Recyclable Corrugated Beverage Container and Holder List of inventors All inventors must be listed person should be listed as an inventor if he or she originated any of the inventions claimed in the application There are no legal limits to the number of inventors and no requirements about the order in which inventors are listed failure to list an inventor could result in patent eventually being declared not valid Field of the invention Explain what type of device product machine or method this invention relates to For example the Coffin patent reads This invention relates to insulating containers and especially to those which are recyclable and made of cellulosic materials Patents and Intellectual Property 341 Background of the invention State the problem that the invention solves Explain the context for the problem what is wrong with existing solutions why new solution is needed and what advantages are offered by the invention Summary of the invention This section should present the substance of the invention in summarized form The summary may point out the advantages of the invention and how it solves the problems described in the background Brief description of the drawings List the figures in the description along with brief description of each drawing For example Figure 10 is perspective view of preferred embodiment illustrating internal flute portions in breakaway views Detailed description of the invention This section of the description is usually the most comprehensive and contains detailed descriptions of embodiments of the invention along with an explanation of how these embodiments work Further discussion of the detailed description is provided below Figures Formal figures for patents must comply with variety of rules about labeling line weight and types of graphical elements However for an invention disclosure or provisional patent application informal figures are sufficient and hand sketches or CAD drawings are perfectly appropriate At some point after filing regular patent application the patent office will request formal figures at which time professional drafter may be hired to prepare formal versions of the necessary figures Prepare enough figures to clearly show the key elements of the invention in the preferred embodiments that have been considered simple invention like the cup holder would probably require to 15 figures The features shown in the figures may be labeled with words outer layer although to facilitate preparation of regular patent application the team may wish to use reference numerals on the figures right from the beginning No rule stipulates that reference numerals must be uninterrupted and consecutive so convenient numbering scheme uses reference numerals 10 11 12 and so on for features that first appear in Figure reference numerals 20 21 22 and so on for features that first appear in Figure and so on This way adding numerals to one figure does not influence the use of numerals in another figure The same feature shown in more than one figure must be labeled with the same reference numeral so some numerals will be carried over from one figure to another Writing the Detailed Description The detailed description describes embodiments of the invention An embodiment is physical realization of the claimed invention Patent law requires that the application describe the preferred embodiment that is the best way of practicing the invention Typically detailed description is organized as collection of paragraphs each describing an embodiment of the invention in terms of its physical structure along with an explanation of how that embodiment works good strategy for writing the detailed description is to first create the figures that show embodiments of the invention Next describe the embodiment by labeling each feature of the embodiment in the figure and explaining the arrangement of these features Finally explain how the embodiment works and why the features are important to this function This process is repeated for each of the embodiments described in the detailed description 342 Chapter 16 EXHIBIT Figure 10 from the Coffin patent FIG 10 Consider Figure 10 from the Coffin patent shown here as Exhibit 16 detailed description might include language like the following preferred embodiment of the invention is shown in Figure 10 liner surface 22 and an outer surface 24 sandwich corrugation 21 The assembly 200 forms tubular shape whose diameter changes linearly with length so as to form section of truncated cone The smooth outer surface 24 provides smooth surface onto which graphics may be printed Corrugation 21 is bonded to outer surface 24 and liner surface 22 with recyclable adhesive The detailed description should show alternative embodiments of the invention For example in the Coffin patent the invention features flutes that create an insulating air gap In preferred embodiment these flutes are formed by smooth wavy corrugations with the smooth surface on the outside to allow for graphics to be easily printed on the sleeve Alternative embodiments include triangle waves and or sheet materials on either or both sides of the tube These alternative embodiments are described in the detailed description and shown in the figures See Exhibit 16 Defensive Disclosure The primary benefit of patent is that it grants the owner Offensive rights That is the owner has the right to prevent others from practicing the invention However patents also offer subtle mechanism for taking defensive actions patent is considered prior art and so an invention that appears in patent may not be patented in the future For this reason inventorsEXHIBIT Figures 6a 6b 7a and 7b from the Coffin patent showing alternative embodiments of the invention Patents and Intellectual Property 343 11 24 21 12 22 Fig 6a Fig 6b 31 44 41 32 42 Fig 7a Fig 7b may benefit from disclosing essentially every invention they considered that relates to the claimed invention no matter how wide ranging This may be done in the detailed description Even though these inventions may not actually be reflected in the claims of the patent their disclosure becomes part of the prior art and therefore prevents others from patenting them This defensive strategy may offer competitive advantages in fields of emerging technologies Step Refine Claims The claims are set of numbered phrases that precisely define the essential elements of the invention The claims are the basis for all offensive patent rights patent owner can prevent others from practicing the invention described by the claims only The rest of the patent application is essentially background and context for the claims Writing the Claims Although claims must be expressed verbally they adhere to strict mathematical logic Almost all claims are formulated as recursive expression of the form whereA This is expressed verbally as AnX comprising an and wherein said is comprised of and and wherein said is Note that claims comply with some verbal conventions The word comprising means including but not limited to and is almost always used as the equal sign in the expression The first time an element say liner sheet is named in claim the inventor uses the indefinite article as in comprises liner sheet Once this element has been named it is never referred to as the liner sheet but always as said liner sheet This is true for every subsequent instance in which liner sheet is used in the claims Although these conventions are344 Chapter 16 not difficult to remember once learned inventors preparing disclosure for subsequent editing by patent attorney should not worry too much about formal correctness of the language The language is easily corrected when the formal patent application is prepared Multiple claims are arranged hierarchically into independent claims and dependent claims Independent claims stand alone and form the root nodes of hierarchy of claims Dependent claims always add further restrictions to an independent claim Dependent claims are typically written in this form The invention of Claim filrther comprising and or The invention of Claim wherein said Dependent claims essentially inherit all of the properties of the independent claim on which they depend In fact dependent claim can be read as if all of the language of the independent claim on which it depends were inserted as replacement for the introductory phrase The invention of Claim The dependent claims are important in that the patent office may reject the independent claim as obvious or not novel while allowing one or more dependent claims In such cases patentable material remains the original independent claim can be deleted and the original dependent claim can be rewritten as an independent claim The elements of claim form logical and relationship To infringe on claim device must include each and every element named in the claim If for example competitive product were to use only three of four elements named in claim it would not infringe on the claim Consider this example from the Coffin patent edited slightly for clarity Claim beverage container holder comprising corrugated tubular member comprising cellulosic material and at least first opening therein for receiving and retaining beverage container said corrugated tubular member comprising fluting means for containing insulating air said fluting means comprising fluting adhesively attached to liner with recyclable adhesive Claim is an independent claim Consider Claim which is dependent on Claim Claim The holder of claim wherein said tubular member further comprises second opening wherein said first opening and said second opening are of unequal cross sectional dimensions This claim adheres to the logical structure shown in Exhibit 16 Let us reinforce the idea that claim is formed of logical and relation among its elements Claim is for holder that includes all of these elements Corrugated tube Made of cellulosic material With first opening With fluting means Made of flutes adhesively attached to liner Using recyclable adhesiveEXHIBIT 16 The logical structure of Claims and from the Coffin patent Note that Claim is dependent on Claim and simply adds further restrictions second opening and relationship between the first and second openings Patents and Intellectual Property 345 Claim cellulosic material fluting means liner flutes __________ recyclable adhesive If competing cup holder does not have every one of these elements it does not infringe upon this claim So for example if it were made of polystyrene it would not infringe on this claim no cellulosic material Consider patent by Jay Sorensen filed shortly after the Coffin patent Sorensen patent is for cup holder with dimpled surface See Exhibit 16 Because this invention does not have fluting means it does not infringe upon the Coffin patent Sorensen claims include the following edited slightly for clarity Claim cup holder comprising band of material formed with an open top and an open bottom through which cup can extend and an inner surface immediately adjacent to said cup said band comprising plurality of discrete spaced apart approximately semi spherically shaped depressions distributed on substantially the entire inner surface of said band so that each depression defines non contacting region of said band creating an air gap between said band and said cup thereby reducing the rate of heat transfer through said holder At least two lessons can be derived from comparing the Coffin and Sorensen inventions First patents often provide relatively limited commercial advantages In this case by creating cup holder with dimples instead of flutes Sorensen was able to avoid infringing on the Coffin patent In fact both inventions are embodied by successful commercial products but neither patent provides ironclad protection from competition The second lesson is that the inventor should invest in considering as many ways as possible to achieve the desired function of the invention in this case an insulating layer Had Coffin thought of dimpled surface then this feature could have been described in his patent application In the best case the dimpled invention may have formed the basis for additional claims in the patent In the worst case the description of the dimpled embodiment in the patent application would have been prior art and therefore prevented Sorensen from obtaining his patent It would not prevent Sorensen and others from practicing the dimpled invention unless it were claimed 346 Chapter 16 EXHIBIT Figure from the Sorensen patent US Patent 425 497 dimpled cup holder Guidelines for Crafting Claims Several guidelines are helpful in crafting claims Writing great claims is tricky so we advise inventors to seek the help of an experienced patent attorney in refining patent application Always try to make claim as general as possible When specific descriptor is used try making it general For example Coffin patent speaks of tubular member and not tube 99 Avoid absolute definitions by using modifiers like substantially essentially and approximately Attempt to create an invention that does not infringe on the draft claim and then try to rewrite the claim or add an additional claim such that the hypothetical invention would infringe Step Pursue Application In most cases the inventor will deliver the draft application to patent attorney or other intellectual property professional for refinement and formal application It is possible to file patent application as an individual if severely budget constrained Pressman provides detailed guidelines for doing this Pressman 2008 Note that the statutory requirements are administratively complex and so we highly recommend that commercialPatents and Intellectual Property 347 product development teams retain competent specialist to pursue any application to the patent office Once an invention disclosure is prepared the team can proceed in four different ways with the specific course of action dictated by the business context The team can file provisional patent application An individual or small company can file provisional patent application for less than 100 in filing fees The application need contain only description of the invention and need not comply with the formalities of regular patent application Once provisional application is filed product may be labeled patent pending If the team wishes to pursue regular patent application this application must be filed within one year of the filing of the provisional patent application provisional patent therefore acts as an option to pursue regular patent application and allows the team time to pursue licensing or further investigation before incurring the expense of regular patent application The team may file regular patent application in the United States This process costs about 500 in filing fees for small company or individual in addition to the legal fees for patent attorney The team may file patent cooperation treaty or PCT application PCT application allows single patent application in single country say the United States to initiate the process of pursuing international patent protection Eventually the inventor must pursue patent protection in individual countries or collections of countries European Union However the PCT process allows the first steps of the process to be carried out relatively efficiently and with single point of contact The entire process of pursuing foreign patent rights is beyond the scope of this chapter Consult patent attorney for details The team can defer application indefinitely The team may delay in hope that future information will make course of action obvious In some cases the team may decide not to pursue the invention and therefore may decide to abandon the patent application process The consequences of delay may be substantial If the invention is disclosed publicly then all international patent rights are forgone If year passes after public disclosure without filing regular patent application then patent rights are also forgone Nevertheless the team may be able to defer any action for several months before these eventualities are realized At some point after the team files regular patent application or PTO application the patent office will issue an oflice action responding to the application In almost all cases patent examiner will reject many or all of the claims as either obvious or not novel This is the norm and it is part of back and forth exchange between the patent office and inventor that should eventually result in claims that are patentable Next the inventor and patent attorney sharpen arguments edit claims to reflect comments from the examiner and respond to the office action with an amended application Most applications eventually result in an issued patent although the claims rarely remain exactly as originally written The patent office does not review or act on provisional patent applications It merely records their filing and stores the application for review when and if regular application is filed 348 Chapter 16 Step Reflect on the Results and the Process In reflecting on the patent application or invention disclosure the team should consider at least the following questions What are the essential and distinctive features of the product concept and therefore the invention Are these features reflected in the description of the invention and in the claims Does the description communicate the best way of practicing the invention What is the timing of future required actions The team patent attorney will typically maintain docket essentially calendar indicating when further actions must be taken to preserve patent rights However the inventor or someone within the team company should also be responsible for thinking about the actions that must be taken in the coming months Which aspects of the process of preparing the patent application or invention disclosure went smoothly and which aspects require further efforts in the future What did the team learn about the prior art that may inform future product development efforts For example are there valuable technologies that might be licensed from existing patent holders Are competitors patents expiring possibly allowing the team to use convenient solution to long standing problem How strong an intellectual property position does the team have Are the features of the invention in the patent application so novel and valuable that they really prevent competitors from direct competition or is the patent likely to be merely deterrent to the most direct copies of the products that embody the invention Did the team begin the process too early or too late Was the effort rushed What is the ideal timing for the next effort to prepare patent application Summary patent is temporary monopoly granted by government to exclude others from using making or selling an invention Patent law is intended to balance an incentive for invention with the free dissemination of information Utility patents are the central element of the intellectual property for most technologybased product development efforts An invention can be patented if it is useful novel and nonobvious The final invention that is patented is defined by the patent claims The rest of the patent application essentially serves as background and explanation in support of the claims We recommend seven step process for pursuing patent Formulate strategy and plan Study prior inventions Outline claims Write the description of the invention Refine claims Patents and Intellectual Property 349 Pursue application Reflect on the results and the process Provisional patent applications and patent cooperation treaty PCT applications can be used to minimize the costs of pursuing patent protection while preserving all future options References and Bibliography Many current

that are very different from the Coffin and Sorensen inventions to address the problem of handling hot coffee cup and that don infringe the Coffin and Sorensen patents Thought Questions Controversy erupted in 1999 when the Smucker Company sued Michigan bakery Albie for infringing on its patent by marketing crustless peanut butter and jelly sandwich crimped on the edges See US patent 004 596 Albie argued that the patent was issued in error because the invention was obvious Look up the Smucker patent Do you believe that the Smucker invention is nonobvious Why or why not Why might an inventor describe but not claim an invention in patent 350 Chapter 16 Appendix Trademarks trademark is word or symbol associated with the products of particular manufacturer Trademarks can form an important element of the portfolio of intellectual property owned by company Trademarks can be words word marks stylized graphics spelling out words and or symbols Trademarks usually correspond to brands product names and sometimes to company names Trademark law is intended to prevent unfair competition which could result if one manufacturer named its products like those of another in an attempt to confuse the public In fact to avoid confusion when manufacturer uses competitor trademark in advertising say for the purposes of comparison it must by law indicate that the name is trademark of the competitor Trademarks must not be purely descriptive For example although company could not obtain trademark on Insulating Sleeve it could for names that are suggestive but not purely descriptive such as Insleev ThermaJo or CupPup In the United States federal trademark may be established merely by using the mark in interstate commerce This is done by attaching TM to the word or symbol when used in advertising or labeling the product JavaJacketTM Trademarks may also be registered at modest cost through the United States Patent and Trademark Office using simple process When registered trademark is denoted with the symbol Coke Given the importance of the Internet for communicating with customers when creating new product names the team should strive to create trademarks that correspond exactly to domain names on the Internet Appendix Advice to Individual Inventors Most students of product development and product development professionals have at some point had an idea for novel product Often further thought results in product concept which sometimes embodies patentable invention common misconception among inventors is that raw idea or even product concept is highly valuable Here is some advice based on observations of many inventors and product commercialization efforts patent can be useful element of plan for developing and commercializing product However it is not really central element of that activity Patenting an invention can usually wait until many of the technical and market risks have been addressed patent by itself rarely has any commercial value An idea by itself has even less value To extract value from product opportunity an inventor must typically complete product design resolving the difficult trade offs associated with addressing customer needs while minimizing production costs Once this hard work is completed product design may have substantial value In most cases pursuing patent is notPatents and Intellectual Property 351 worth the effort except as part of larger effort to take product concept through to substantial development milestone such as working prototype If the design is proven through prototyping and testing patent can be an important mechanism for increasing the value of this intellectual property Licensing patent to manufacturer as an individual inventor is very difficult If you are serious about your product opportunity be prepared to pursue commercialization of your product on your own or in partnership with smaller company Once you have demonstrated market for the product licensing to larger entity becomes much more likely File provisional patent application For very little money an individual using the guidelines in this chapter can file provisional application This action provides patent protection for year while you evaluate whether your idea is worth pursuing CHAPTER SEVENTEEN Product Development Economics 45 Polaroid Photo courtesy of Arne List EXHIBIT 17 One of
