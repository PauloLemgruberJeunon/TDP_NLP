Development Product Concept Perform Economic Analysis Benchmark Competitive Products Build and Test Models and Prototypes EXHIBIT Concept testing in relation to other concept development activities The emPower Corporation start up company had developed new product concept to address the personal transportation market Exhibit shows photograph of prototype of the product The concept was three wheeled electric powered scooter that could be folded up and carried easily emPower wished to assess the customer response to this concept in order to decide whether to proceed with its development and to support the company financing efforts In this chapter we focus primarily on testing done during the concept development phase In concept test the development team solicits response to description of the product concept from potential customers in the target market This type of testing may be used to select which of two or more concepts should be pursued to gather information from potential customers on how to improve concept and to estimate the sales potential of the product Note that various other types of testing with potential customers may be completed at times other than during concept development For example some kind of customer test usually based on only verbal description of concept may be used in identifying the original product opportunity that forms the basis of the mission statement for the project test may also be used to refine the demand forecast after the development of product is nearly complete but before firm commits to full production and launch Exhibit shows concept testing relative to other concept development activities Concept testing is closely related to concept selection Chapter in that both activities aim to further narrow the set of concepts under consideration However concept testing is distinct in that it is based on data gathered directly from potential customers and relies to lesser degree on judgments made by the development team The reason that concept testing generally follows concept selection is that team cannot feasibly test more than few concepts directly with potential customers As result the team must first narrow the set of alternatives under consideration to very few Concept testing is also closely related to prototyping Chapter 14 because concept testing invariably involves some kind of representation of the product concept often prototype One of the end results of concept test may be an estimate of how many units of the product the company is likely to sell This forecast is key element of the information used in making an economic analysis of the product Chapter 17 team may choose not to do any concept testing at all if the time required to test the concept is large relative to the product life cycles in the product category or if the cost of testing is large relative to the cost of actually launching the product For example in the Internet software business some observers and practitioners argue that just launching aConcept Testing 67 product and iteratively refining it with subsequent product generations is better strategy than carefully testing concept before developing it fully While perhaps appropriate for some products this strategy would be foolish in the development of for example new commercial airplane where development costs and time are huge and failure can be disastrous Most product categories fall between these extremes and in most cases some form of concept testing is warranted This chapter presents seven step method for testing product concepts Define the purpose of the concept test Choose survey population Choose survey format Communicate the concept Measure customer response Interpret the results Iesnewwe Reflect on the results and the process We illustrate this method with the scooter example Step Define the Purpose of the Concept Test As first step in concept testing we recommend that the team explicitly articulate in writing the questions that the team wishes to answer with the test Concept testing is essentially an experimental activity and as with any experiment knowing the purpose of the experiment is essential to designing an effective experimental method This step is closely analogous to defining the purpose in prototyping See Chapter 14 Prototyping The primary questions addressed in concept testing are typically Which of several alternative concepts should be pursued How can the concept be improved to better meet customer needs Approximately how many units are likely to be sold Should development be continued Step Choose Survey Population An assumption underlying the concept test is that the population of potential customers surveyed reflects that of the target market for the product If the survey population is either more or less enthusiastic about the product than will be the eventual target audience for the product then inferences based on the concept test will be biased As result the team should choose survey population that mirrors the target market in as many ways as possible In the actual survey the first few questions are called the screener questions and generally are used to verify that the respondent fits the definition of the target market for the product Often product addresses multiple market segments In such cases an accurate concept test requires that potential customers from each target segment be surveyed Surveying every possible segment may be prohibitively expensive in cost or time and in168 Chapter EXHIBIT Factors leading to relatively smaller or larger survey sample sizes Factors Favoring Smaller Factors Favoring Larger Sample Size Sample Size Test occurs early in concept development Test occurs later in concept development process process Test is primarily intended to gather Test is primarily intended to assess demand qualitative data quantitatively Surveying potential customers is relatively Surveying customers is relatively fast and costly in time or money inexpensive Required investment to develop and launch Required investment to develop and launch the product is relatively small the product is relatively high relatively large fraction of the target relatively small fraction of the target market is expected to value the product market is expected to value the product many positively inclined respondents many people have to be sampled to reliably can be found without large sample estimate the fraction that values the product such cases the team may choose to survey potential customers from only the largest segment However when only one segment is sampled inferences about the response of the entire market are likely to be biased For the scooter there were two primary consumer segments college students and urban commuters The team decided to form survey population from both segments The team had also identified several smaller secondary segments including transportation for factory and airport employees The sample size of the survey should be large enough that the team confidence in the results is high enough to guide decision making Sample sizes for concept testing are sometimes as small as 10 when gathering qualitative feedback on new surgical device for highly specialized procedure or as large as 000 when trying to quantitatively assess the potential demand for new portable telephone that is targeted at market segment comprising 10 million households Although there are no simple formulas for determining sample size some of the factors driving sample size are shown in Exhibit Depending on the desired data to be collected from the concept testing process the team may actually structure multiple surveys with different objectives Each of these surveys may involve different sample population and different sample size The emPower team performed two different concept tests In early concept testing the team sampled only dozen or so potential customers to solicit feedback on the attractiveness of the basic concept Later the team performed purchase intent survey of 000 customers This survey was used to make demand forecast on which financing decisions were based Because of the importance of this objective the team felt that the time and expense associated with such large sample were justified Step Choose Survey Format The following formats are commonly used in concept testing Face to face interaction In this format an interviewer interacts directly with the respondent Face to face interactions can take the form of intercepts stopping people at mall in park or on city street interviews prearranged by telephone Concept Testing 69 interviews with potential customers at trade show booth or focus groups prearranged group discussions with 12 people Telephone Telephone interviews may be prearranged and targeted at very specific individuals pediatric dentists or may be cold calls of consumers from target population Postal mail In mail surveys concept testing materials are sent and respondents are asked to return completed form Postal surveys are somewhat slower than other methods and suffer from relatively poor response rates Some kind of incentive often cash or gift is sometimes offered to increase response Electronic mail Electronic mail surveys are very similar to postal mail surveys except that as of this writing respondents seem slightly more likely to reply than via postal mail With the proliferation of unwanted mail this tendency may not persist Many electronic mail users react extremely negatively to unsolicited commercial correspondence We therefore recommend that electronic mail surveys be used only when respondents are likely to perceive benefit to their participation or when the team has already established some kind of positive relationship with the target population Internet Using the Internet team may create virtual concept testing site in which survey participants can observe concepts and provide responses An electronic mail message is usually used to recruit respondents to visit the test site Each of these formats presents risks of sample bias For example the use of electronic formats may bias the sample toward those who are technologically sophisticated For some products this sophistication is part of the profile of the target market the target market for Internet software products is likely to be comfortable with electronic survey formats Conversely an Internet survey might be particularly bad format for testing television based computer concept targeted at people without personal computers Exploratory testing typical in the early phases of concept development benefits from open ended interactive formats We recommend that the team use face to face formats when presenting multiple concept alternatives or when soliciting ideas for improving concept In these settings the product developers themselves benefit from performing the interviews because they can directly observe reactions to the product in rich detail As the purpose of the concept test becomes more focused more structured formats such as mail and telephone become more appropriate If the questions are very focused the team can hire market research firm to implement the concept test When gathering data intended primarily for use in forecasting demand third parties are generally used to collect the data in face to face formats This helps to avoid sympathy bias respondents indicating that they like the concept in order to please an anxious product developer Step Communicate the Concept The choice of survey format is closely linked to the way in which the concept will be communicated Concepts can be communicated in any of the following ways listed in order of increasing richness of the description Verbal description verbal description is generally short paragraph or collection of bullet points summarizing the product concept This description may be read170 Chapter EXHIBIT Sketch of scooter concept Sketch by David Wallace by the respondent or may be read aloud by the person administering the survey For example the scooter concept might be described as follows The product is lightweight electric scooter that can be easily folded and taken with you inside building or on public transportation The scooter weighs about 25 pounds It travels at speeds up to 15 miles per hour and can go about 12 miles on single charge The scooter can be recharged in about two hours from standard electric outlet The scooter is easy to ride and has simple controlsijust an accelerator button and brake Sketch Sketches are usually line drawings showing the product in perspective perhaps with annotations of key features Exhibit shows sketch of the scooter concept Photos and renderings Photographs can be used to communicate the concept when appearance models exist for the product concept Renderings are nearly photo realistic illustrations of the concept Renderings can be created with pens and markers or using computer aided design tools Exhibit shows rendering of the scooter created using computer aided design software Storyboard storyboard is series of images that communicates temporal sequence of actions involving the product For example one of the potential benefits of the scooter is that it can be easily stored and transported This scenario is illustrated in the storyboard in Exhibit Video Video images allow even more dynamism than the storyboard With Video the form of the product itself can be clearly communicated as can the way in which the product is used The scooter team used video in its purchase intent survey TheEXHIBIT Rendering of the scooter from computer aided design software EXHIBIT Storyboard illustrating storage transportation and use scenarios Concept Testing 71 compact storage portable transportation Courtesy of emPower Corporation reduced am transit Courtesy of emPower Corporation172 Chapter EXHIBIT Appearance model of the scooter concept Courtesy of emPower Corporation video showed students and commuters riding prototypes of the product and showed an animation of the folding mechanism Simulation Simulation is generally implemented as software that mimics the function or interactive features of the product Simulation would probably not be the ideal way to communicate the key features of scooter but in some other cases simulation can be effective For example in testing controls for electronic devices visual image of the de vice can be created on the computer screen and the user can control the simulated device via touch screen or mouse clicks and can observe simulated displays and sounds Interactive multimedia Interactive multimedia combines the visual richness of video with the interactivity of simulation Using multimedia you can display video and still images of the product The respondent can view verbal and graphical information and can listen to audio information Interaction allows the respondent to choose from among several sources of available information on the product and in some cases to experience the controls and displays of simulated product Unfortunately the development of multimedia systems remains expensive and therefore may be justified only for large product development efforts Physical appearance models Physical appearance models also known as looks like models vividly display the form and appearance of product They are often made of wood or polymer foams and are painted to look like real products In some cases limited functionality is included in the model The scooter team built several looks like models one of which was articulated so that the folding feature could be demonstrated Exhibit shows photograph of this model EXHIBIT Working prototype of the scooter concept Concept Testing 73 Courtesy of emPower Corporation Working prototypes When available working prototypes or works like models can be useful in concept testing However the use of working prototypes is also risky The primary risk is that the respondents will equate the prototype with the finished product In some cases prototypes perform better than the ultimate product because the prototype uses better more expensive components such as motors or batteries In most cases the prototype performs worse than the ultimate product and is almost always less visually attractive than the ultimate product Sometimes separate works like and looks like prototypes can be used one to illustrate how the product will appear in production and the other to illustrate how it would work Exhibit shows working prototype of the scooter which was used in some early concept testing Matching the Survey Format with the Means of Communicating the Concept The choice of survey format is tightly linked to the means of communicating the product concept For example the team obviously cannot demonstrate the scooter with working model using telephone survey Exhibit identifies which means of communicating concepts are appropriate for each survey format Issues in Communicating the Concept When communicating the product concept the team must decide how aggressively to promote the product and its benefits The scooter could be described as an electricpowered personal mobility device or as an exciting new electric scooter that provides174 Chapter EXHIBIT Appropriateness of different survey formats for different ways of communicating the product concept Electronic Postal Face toTelephone Mail Mail Internet Face Verbal description Sketch Photo or rendering Storyboard Video Simulation Interactive multimedia Physical appearance model Working prototype freedom from gridlock In our view the description of the concept should closely mirror the information that the user is likely to consider when making purchase decision If highly promotional information is used it can be labeled as sample advertisement perhaps supplemented by mock ups of magazine articles or comments by current owners providing additional descriptions of the product Researchers and practitioners argue endlessly about whether the purchase price of the product should be included as part of the concept description Price is very powerful lever on customer response and therefore pricing information can dramatically influence the results of concept test We recommend that price be omitted from the concept description unless the price of the product is expected to be unusually high or low For example the primary benefit of concept may be that it provides basic functionality at very low price In this case price must be included as part of the concept description Conversely product may provide extremely high performance or unique features but only at relatively high price In this case price must also be included as part of the concept description When the price of the product is likely to be quite similar to existing products and to customer expectations price can be omitted from the concept description Instead of including price in the concept description we suggest that the respondent be asked explicitly what his or her expectation of price would be If the resulting customer expectations differ substantially from the team pricing plans then the team may need to either consider modifications to the concept or repeat the concept test including price as product attribute Because the scooter was new product category for which customers had not developed clear pricing expectations the emPower team chose to include their target price as part of the concept description Instead of showing single concept the team may choose to ask respondent to select from several alternatives This approach is attractive when the team is trying to decide among several concepts under consideration variant on this approach is to present the concept for the new product along with descriptions and pictures of the most successful existing products This approach has the advantage of allowing respondents to directly assess attributes of the product concept in comparison to those of competitors Assuming the products would be equally distributed and promoted this approach also allows the team to estimate potential market share Using forced choice survey technique is likely to be most effective in cases for which there is narrowly defined product category with relatively few existing products Concept Testing 75 Step Measure Customer Response Most concept test surveys first communicate the product concept and then measure customer response When concept test is performed early in the concept development phase customer response is usually measured by asking the respondent to choose from two or more alternative concepts Additional questions focus on why respondents react the way they do and on how the product concepts could be improved Concept tests also generally attempt to measure purchase intent The most commonly used purchase intent scale has five response categories Definitely would buy Probably would buy Might or might not buy Probably would not buy Definitely would not buy There are many alternatives to this scale including providing seven or more response categories or asking respondents to indicate numerical probability of purchase Exhibit 10 shows an example of survey form for the scooter This form was designed to be an interview guide for face to face format in which both brochure and working prototype were used to communicate the product concept Step Interpret the Results If the team is simply interested in comparing two or more concepts interpretation of the results is straightforward If one concept dominates the others and the team is confident that the respondents understood the key differences among the concepts then the team can simply choose the preferred concept If the results are not conclusive the team may decide to choose concept based on cost or other considerations or may decide to offer multiple versions of the product Note that care must be applied in making this judgment for cases in which manufacturing costs are dramatically different among the concepts under comparison and in which no price information is communicated to the respondents In such cases respondents may be biased to select the most costly alternative In many cases the team is also interested in estimating the demand for product in the period following launch usually one year Here we present model for estimating the sales potential of durables By durables we mean products that last several years and for which there is therefore negligible repeat purchase rate These products are in contrast to consumer packaged goods like razor blades toothpaste or frozen food for which forecasting models must consider rates of trial and subsequent repeat purchase Before proceeding with the model we note that forecasting sales of new products is subject to great deal of uncertainty and exhibits notoriously high errors Nevertheless forecasts do tend to be correlated with actual demand and so provide useful information to the team We estimate the quantity of the product expected to be sold during time period as P176 Chapter CONCEPT TEST SURVEY Electric

stable product category bicycles is the expected number of purchases to be made of existing products in the category over the time period is the fraction of these potential customers or purchases for which the product is available and the customer is aware of the product In situations where awareness and availability are assumed to be separate independent factors they are multiplied together to generate is the probability that the product is purchased if available and if the customer is aware of it is estimated in turn by Cdefinitely definitely Cprobably probablyConcept Testing 77 definitely is the fraction of survey respondents indicating in the concept test survey that they would definitely purchase often called the top box score Fprobably is the fraction of survey respondents indicating that they would probably purchase often called the second box score Cdefinitely and Cprobably are calibration constants usually established based on the experience of company with similar products in the past Generally the values of Cdefinitely and Cprobably fall in these intervals 10 Cdefinitely 50 Cprobably 25 Absent prior history many teams use values of Cdefinitely and Cprobably Note that these values reflect the typical bias of respondents to overestimate the probability that they would actually purchase the product Among other possible schemes for estimating is function that includes the fraction of respondents in all of the response categories not just the top two For product associated with an entirely new category portable commuter scooters the interpretation of these variables is slightly different In this case is the number of customers in the target market for the new product and is the probability of targetmarket customer purchasing the product within given time period often year Note that this interpretation is reflected in the survey questions in Exhibit 10 in which the respondent is asked to indicate the likelihood of purchase within the next year To clarify the model consider these two numerical examples corresponding to two different market segments and possible product positionings for the scooter concept Scooter Sold as Single Person Transportation in Large Factories This is an existing category Assume that scooters are currently sold into this market at rate of 150 000 units per year 150 000 Assume that the company sells the product through single distributor that accounts for 25 percent of the sales in this category 25 Assume that results from concept test with factory managers responsible for purchasing transportation devices indicate definitely would buy fraction of 30 and probably wouldbuy fraction of 20 If we use value of for Cdefinitely and for Cprobably then 30 20 16 and 150 000 25 16 000 units year Scooter Sold to College Students This is new category and therefore poses much more difficult estimation challenge First what should be the value of Strictly speaking as of this writing there are very few existing sales of electric scooters to college students However we could define several other ways For example how many students purchase bicycles or motor scooters intended for basic transportation of up to two miles This number is approximately million per year Alternatively how many students must travel distances of between one and three miles either in commuting from home or traveling between classes or other school activities This number is approximately million Assume that we sample students in this second group and that we obtain definitelywould buy fraction of 10 and probably would buy fraction of 05 Note that these numbers represent the fraction of respondents that indicate intent to purchase within one year Further assume that the company plans to sell the scooter through bicycle stores near campuses and advertise in campus newspapers for the 100 largest college campuses in the United States Based on this plan the company expects that 30 percent of the students178 Chapter in the target market will be aware of the product and have convenient access to dealer If we use value of for Cdefinitely and for Cprobably then 10 05 05 and 000 000 30 05 30 000 units in the first year The results of forecasts based on concept testing should be interpreted with caution Some firms mostly after repeated experience with similar products have achieved impressive levels of accuracy in their forecasts While forecasts do tend to be correlated with actual sales most individual forecasts exhibit substantial errors Some of the factors that can cause actual purchase patterns to differ from the purchase intentions expressed in surveys include Importance of word of mouth When the benefits of product are not immediately obvious the enthusiasm of existing users may be an important factor in generating demand This factor is not generally captured in concept testing Fidelity of the concept description If the actual product differs substantially from the description of the product in the concept test then actual sales are likely to differ from the forecast Pricing If the price of the product deviates substantially from the price indicated in the survey or from the expectations of survey respondents then forecasts are likely to be inaccurate Level of promotion Spending on advertising and other forms of promotion can increase demand for most products The influence of promotion is accounted for only weakly in the forecasting model via the awareness availability term and via the materials used to present the concept Step Reflect on the Results and the Process The primary benefit of the concept test is in getting feedback from real potential customers The qualitative insights gathered through open ended discussions with respondents about the proposed concepts may be the most important result of concept testing especially early in the development process The team should reflect on this evidence as well as on the numerical outcome of its forecast The team benefits from thinking about the impact of the three key variables in the forecasting model the overall size of the market the availability and awareness of the product and the fraction of customers who are likely to purchase Considering alternative markets for the product can sometimes increase the first factor The second factor can be increased through distribution arrangements and promotion plans The third factor can be increased through changes to the product design and possibly advertising that improve the attractiveness of the product In considering these factors sensitivity analysis can yield useful insights and aids in decision making For example what would be the impact on sales if the team were able to secure partnership with retailer and therefore increase by 20 percent Concept Testing 79 In reflecting on the results of the concept test the team should ask two key diagnostic questions First was the concept communicated in way that is likely to elicit customer response that reflects true intent For example if one of the primary benefits of the concept is its aesthetic appeal was the concept presented in way that this aspect of the product was clear to respondents Second is the resulting forecast consistent with observed sales rates of similar products For example if only 000 gasoline powered GoPed scooters competing product are currently sold to college students each year why does the emPower team believe it will sell 30 times as many of its product Finally we note that experience with new product is likely to be applicable to future similar products The team can benefit from its experience by documenting the results of its concept testing and by attempting to reconcile these results with subsequent observations of product success Summary concept test solicits direct response to description of the product concept from potential customers in the target market Concept testing is distinct from concept selection in that it is based on data gathered directly from potential customers and relies to lesser degree on judgments made by the development team Concept testing can verify that customer needs have been adequately met by the product concept assess the sales potential of product concept and or gather customer information for refining the product concept Concept testing is appropriate at several different points in the development process when identifying the original product opportunity when selecting which of two or more concepts should be pursued when assessing the sales potential of product concept and or when deciding whether to continue further development and commercialization of the product We recommend seven step method for testing product concepts Define the purpose of the concept test Choose survey population
