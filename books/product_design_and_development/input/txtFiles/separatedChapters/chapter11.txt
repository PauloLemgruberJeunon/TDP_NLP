Mobile Phone Super Computer Camera Laptop Computer Coffeemaker Desktop Wristwatch Computer Office Chair Hard Disk Drive OAutomobile Technology Driven User Driven Products Products EXHIBIT Classification of some common products on the continuum from technology driven product to user driven product chair is largely user driven While these products may be technically sophisticated the technology does not differentiate the product thus for the product development team the ID considerations will be more important than the technical requirements The role of engineering may still be important to determine any technical features of the product however since the technology is often already established the development team focuses on the user aspects of the product Exhibit 11 classifies variety of familiar products Rarely does product belong at one of the two extremes Instead most products fall somewhere along the continuum These classifications can be dynamic For example when company develops product based on new core technology the company is often interested in bringing the product to market as quickly as possible Because little emphasis is placed on how the product looks or is used the initial role of ID is small However as competitors enter the market the product may need to compete more along user or aesthetic dimensions The product original classification shifts and ID assumes an extremely important role in the development process One classic example is the Apple MacBook laptop computer The core benefit of the first Apple laptop was its technology highly portable computer using the Macintosh operating system As competition entered this market however Apple relied heavily on ID to create aesthetic appeal and enhanced utility adding to the technical advantages of subsequent models Timing of Industrial Design Involvement Typically ID is incorporated into the product development process during the later phases for technology driven product and throughout the entire product development process for user driven product Exhibit 11 illustrates these timing differences Note that the ID process is subprocess of the product development process it is parallel but not separate As shown in the exhibit the ID process described above may be rapid relative to the overall development process The technical nature of the problems that confront engineers in their design activities typically demands substantially more development effort than do the issues considered by ID Exhibit 11 shows that for technology driven product ID activities may begin fairly late in the program This is because ID for such products is focused primarily on packaging issues For user driven product ID is involved much more fully In fact the ID process may dominate the overall product development process for many user driven products Industrial Design 223 Concept Development Identification Concept Concept System Deta_ DeSIgn Production

EXHIBIT Relative timing of the industrial design process for two types of products Exhibit 11 10 describes the responsibilities of ID during each phase of the product development process and how they relate to the other activities of the development team As with the timing of ID involvement the responsibilities of ID may also change according to product type Product Development Activity Type of Product Technology Driven User Driven Identification of Customer Needs Concept Generation and Selection Concept Testing System Level Design Detail Design Testing and Refinement ID typically has no involvement ID works with marketing and engineering to ensure that human factors and user interface issues are addressed Safety and maintenance issues are often of primary importance ID helps engineering to create prototypes which are shown to customers for feedback ID typically has little involvement ID is responsible for packaging the product once most of the engineering details have been addressed ID receives product specifications and constraints from engineering and marketing ID works closely with marketing to identify customer needs Industrial designers participate in focus groups or one on one customer interviews ID generates multiple concepts according to the industrial design process flow described earlier ID leads in the creation of models to be tested with customers by marketing ID narrows down the concepts and refines the most promising approaches ID selects final concept then coordinates with engineering manufacturing and marketing to finalize the design EXHIBIT The role of industrial design according to product type 224 Chapter Assessing the Quality of Industrial Design Assessing the quality of ID for finished product is an inherently subjective task However we can qualitatively determine whether ID has accomplished its goals by considering each aspect of the product that is influenced by ID Below are five categories for evaluating product These categories roughly match Dreyfuss five critical goals for ID presented earlier in this chapter We use these categories to develop specific questions allowing the product to be rated along five dimensions Exhibit 11 11 demonstrates this method by showing results for the RAZR Quality of the User Interface This is rating of how easy the product is to use Interface quality is related to the product appearance feel and modes of interaction Do the features of the product effectively communicate their operation to the user Is the product use intuitive Are all features safe Have all potential users and uses of the product been considered Examples of product specific questions include Is the grip comfortable Does the control knob turn easily and smoothly Is the power switch easy to locate Is the display easy to read and understand Emotional Appeal This is rating of the overall consumer appeal of the product Appeal is achieved in part through appearance feel sound and smell Is the product attractive Is it exciting Does the product express quality What images come to mind when viewing it Does the product inspire pride of ownership Does the product evoke feelings of pride among the development team and sales staff Examples of product specific questions include How does the car door sound when slammed Does the hand tool feel solid and sturdy Does the appliance look good on the kitchen counter Ability to Maintain and Repair the Product This is rating of the ease of product maintenance and repair Maintenance and repair should be considered along with the other user interactions Industrial Design 225 Assessment Category Performance Rating Explanation of Rating Quality of the User Interface Emotional Appeal Ability to Maintain and Repair the Product Appropriate Use of Resources Product Differentiation Low Medium High In general the RAZR was both easy to use and comfortable Calls could be answered by simply opening the display numbers and text could be easily entered using the keypad and the functions were readily accessible using the navigation buttons The RAZR drawbacks included keypad that could be difficult to use for customers with large fingers or long fingernails In some markets carriers had specified that Motorola customize the software interface in ways that negatively impacted usability The RAZR had high emotional appeal that stemmed from its ultra thin form pocketability and finishes Although maintenance and repair were not of primary importance to the customer the RAZR rated high in this category The battery charged very quickly and could be removed and replaced easily The final design included only those features that satisfied real customer needs Materials were selected for durability and manufacturability to withstand extreme conditions to meet environmental regulations and to create an attractive appearance The RAZR appearance was clearly unique It was easily identified when viewed in public area or next to competitor product EXHIBIT Assessment of industrial design role in the RAZR development project Is the maintenance of the product obvious Is it easy D0 product features effectively communicate disassembly and assembly procedures Examples of product specific questions include How easy and obvious is it to clear paper jam in the printer How difficult is it to disassemble and clean the food processor How long does it take to change the batteries in the remote controller 226 Chapter Appropriate Use of Resources This is rating of how well resources were used in satisfying the customer needs Resources typically refer to the dollar expenditures on ID and other functions These factors tend to drive costs such as manufacturing poorly designed product one with unnecessary features or product made from an exotic material will affect tooling manufacturing processes assembly processes and the like This category asks whether these investments were well spent How well were resources used to satisfy the customer requirements Is the material selection appropriate in terms of cost and quality Is the product over or underdesigned does it have features that are unnecessary or neglected Were environmental ecological factors considered Product Differentiation This is rating of product uniqueness and consistency with the corporate identity This differentiation arises predominantly from appearance Will customer who sees the product in store be able to identify it because of its appearance Will it be remembered by consumer who has seen it in an advertisement Will it be recognized when seen on the street Does the product fit with or enhance the corporate identity From an ID perspective as shown in Exhibit 11 the RAZR was an excellent product It was novel recognizable durable easy to fabricate and had strong customer appeal Since these features were extremely important to the consumer ID played critical role in determining the immediate market success of the product Summary This chapter introduces the topic of industrial design explains its benefits to product quality and illustrates how the ID process takes place The primary mission of ID is to design the aspects of product that relate to the user aesthetics and ergonomics Most products can benefit in some way or another from ID The more product is seen or used by people the more it will depend on good ID for its success For products that are characterized by high degree of user interaction and the need for aesthetic appeal ID should be involved throughout the product development process Early involvement of industrial designers will ensure that critical aesthetic and user requirements will not be overlooked or ignored by the technical staff When product success relies more on technology ID can be integrated into the development process later Active involvement of ID on the product development team can help to promote good communication between functional groups Such communication facilitates coordination and ultimately translates into higher quality products Industrial Design 227 References and Bibliography Many current resources are available on the Internet via www rich eppinger net For more information
