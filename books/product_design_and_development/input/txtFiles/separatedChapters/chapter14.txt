289290 Chapter 14 Courtesy of iRobot Corp EXHIBIT The PackBot ready for deployment in military search operation The iRobot PackBot line of tactical mobile robots was designed by iRobot Corporation to assist law enforcement and military personnel to conduct operations in dangerous environments For example PackBot robots were used to help search for survivors in the wreckage of the World Trade Center in September 2001 They have assisted military operations around the world and they are used by police for bomb retrieval and disposal The mobile chassis of the PackBot accepts wide range of payloads including robotic arm that can be fitted with gripper video camera lighting acoustic sensors chemical and radiation detectors or specialized equipment such as that needed for disarming bombs Exhibit l4 shows the PackBot configured with robotic arm camera gripper and fiber optic communications tether Exhibit 14 shows the PackBot ready for use in the field The PackBot may be carried by military troops thrown through window or dropped off fire truck into wide range of challenging and unpredictable situations In developing the PackBot the product development team at iRobot utilized various forms of prototypes throughout the product development process Prototypes not only helped develop successful product quickly but also helped ensure the reliability of the PackBot in the field This chapter defines prototype explains why prototypes are built and then presents several principles of prototyping practice The chapter also describes method for planning prototypes before they are built The PackBot is used as an illustrative example throughout Prototyping 291 Understanding Prototypes Although dictionaries define prototype as noun only in product development practice the word is used as noun verb and an adjective For example Industrial designers produce prototypes of their concepts Engineers prototype design Software developers write prototype programs We define prototype as an approximation of the product along one or more dimensions of interest Under this definition any entity exhibiting at least one aspect of the product that is of interest to the development team can be viewed as prototype This definition deviates from standard usage in that it includes such diverse forms of prototypes as concept sketches mathematical models simulations test components and fully functional preproduction versions of the product Prototyping is the process of developing such an approximation of the product Types of Prototypes Prototypes can be usefully classified along two dimensions The first dimension is the degree to which prototype is physical as opposed to analytical Physical prototypes are tangible artifacts created to approximate the product Aspects of the product of interest to the development team are actually built into an artifact for testing and experimentation Examples of physical prototypes include models that look and feel like the product proof of concept prototypes used to test an idea quickly and experimental hardware used to validate the functionality of product Exhibit 14 shows three forms of physical prototypes used for diverse purposes Analytical prototypes represent the product in nontangible usually mathematical or visual manner Interesting aspects of the product are analyzed rather than built Examples of analytical prototypes include computer simulations systems of equations encoded within spreadsheet and computer models of three dimensional geometry Exhibit 14 shows three forms of analytical prototypes used for diverse purposes The second dimension is the degree to which prototype is comprehensive as opposed to focused Comprehensive prototypes implement most if not all of the attributes of product comprehensive prototype corresponds closely to the everyday use of the word prototype in that it is full scale fully operational version of the product An example of comprehensive prototype is one given to customers in order to identify any remaining design flaws before committing to production In contrast to comprehensive prototypes focused prototypes implement one or few of the attributes of product Examples of focused prototypes include foam models to explore the form of product and hand built circuit boards to investigate the electronic performance of product design common practice is to use two or more focused prototypes together to investigate the overall performance of product One of these prototypes is often looks like prototype and the other is works like prototype By building two separate focused prototypes the team may be able to answer its questions much earlier than if it had to create one integrated comprehensive prototype Exhibit 14 displays plot with axes corresponding to these two dimensions Several different prototypes from the PackBot example are shown on this plot Note that focused292 Chapter 14 EXHIBIT Examples of physical prototypes in the PackBot project

prototypes of the PackBot 3D CAD rendering created for customer proposal finite element analysis of Wheel spoke geometry dynamic simulation model Courtesy of iRobot Corp Prototyping 293294 Chapter 14 prototypes can be either physical or analytical but that for tangible manufactured products fully comprehensive prototypes must generally be physical Prototypes sometimes contain combination of analytical and physical elements For example control hardware including the user interface for the PackBot could be linked to software simulation of the PackBot dynamic motion Some analytical prototypes can be viewed as being more physical than others For example video animation of the PackBot dynamic balance based on simulation of the physical interactions of its components is in one sense more physical than set of equations approximating the overall balance of the same mechanism What Are Prototypes Used For Within product development project prototypes are used for four purposes learning communication integration and milestones Learning Prototypes are often used to answer two types of questions Will it work and How well does it meet the customer needs When used to answer such questions prototypes serve as learning tools In developing the wheels for the PackBot the team built focused physical prototypes of the novel spiral spoke geometry of the wheels The wheels were mounted to weighted platform and dropped at various heights to test the shock absorption properties and the strength of the wheels Exhibit 14 shows several of the wheel prototypes and one of the impact tests Also in development of the wheel design mathematical models of the spokes were analyzed to estimate the stiffness and strength of the wheels This is an example of focused analytical prototype used as learning tool Physical Alpha Prototype for System Integration Wheel ImpactTest Gripper Geometry and System Level Beta Prototype Pad Coating PuIITest DropTest for FieIdTesting Testbed

to which they are physical and the degree to which they implement all of the attributes of the product Prototyping 295 Courtesy of iRobot Corp EXHIBIT 14 PackBot wheel prototypes top and impact testing bottom Communication Prototypes enrich communication with top management vendors partners extended team members customers and investors This is particularly true of physical prototypes visual tactile three dimensional representation of product is much easier to understand than verbal description or even sketch of the product When developing new payload capabilities for the PackBot communication among engineers managers suppliers and customers is enhanced through the use of look and feel prototypes New customers often fail to appreciate the small size of the crush zone into which the PackBot payload must fit however physical model clearly illustrates this space constraint The rough physical prototype shown in Exhibit l4 was used to communicate to early customers the physical size of the PackBot and the range of mobility of its camera support arm This model was constructed from components using stereolithography rapid prototyping technology assembled and painted to represent the actual size and appearance of the product Integration Prototypes are used to ensure that components and subsystems of the product work together as expected Comprehensive physical prototypes are most effective as integration tools in product development projects because they require the assembly and physical interconnection of all the parts and subassemblies that make up product In doing so the296 Chapter 14 prototype forces coordination between different members of the product development team If the combination of any of the components of the product interferes with the overall function of the product the problem may be detected through physical integration in comprehensive prototype Common names for these comprehensive physical prototypes are testbed alpha beta or preproduction prototypes Two such prototypes of the PackBot are shown in Exhibit 14 In the alpha prototype the radios are visible in the center of the robot In the beta prototype the radios were integrated into the body for protection from damage Extensive testing of the alpha prototype helped identify several improvements to the track system which was redesigned before the beta prototype was built Further testing of the beta prototype included wide range of field conditions such as mud sand and water testing Prototypes also help integrate the perspectives of the different functions represented on product development team Leonard Barton 1991 simple physical model of the form of product can be used as the medium through which the marketing design and manufacturing functions agree on basic design decision Many software development processes use prototypes to integrate the activities of dozens of software developers Microsoft for example employs daily build in which new version of the product is compiled at the end of every day Software developers check in their code by fixed time of day 00 pm and team compiles the code to create new prototype version of the software The most recent version of the software is then tested and used by everyone on the team in practice Microsoft calls eating your own dog food This practice of creating daily comprehensive prototypes ensures that the efforts of the developers are always synchronized and integrated Any conflicts are detected immediately and the team can never diverge more than one day from working version of the product Cusumano 1997 Milestones Particularly in the later stages of product development prototypes are used to demonstrate that the product has achieved desired level of functionality Milestone prototypes provide tangible goals demonstrate progress and serve to enforce the schedule Senior management and sometimes the customer often requires prototype that demonstrates certain functions before allowing the project to proceed For example in many government procurements prototype must pass qualification test and later Courtesy of iRobot Corp EXHIBIT Alpha left and beta right prototypes of the PackBot Prototyping 297 Learning Communication Integration Milestones Focused analytical Focused physical Comprehensive physical EXHIBIT Appropriateness of different types of prototypes for different purposes more appropriate less appropriate Note that fully comprehensive analytical prototypes are rarely possible for physical products first article test before contractor can proceed with production major milestone for the PackBot development was test conducted by the US Army During this test the PackBot prototype was thrown out of moving vehicle and controlled by soldier with minimal training in an unknown environment There could be no failures of the PackBot system and its user interface in order to pass this test While all types of prototypes are used for all four of these purposes some types of prototypes are more appropriate than others for some purposes summary of the relative appropriateness of different types of prototypes for different purposes is shown in Exhibit 14 Principles of Prototyping Several principles are useful in guiding decisions about prototypes during product development These principles inform decisions about what type of prototype to build and about how to incorporate prototypes into the development project plan Analytical Prototypes Are Generally More Flexible Than Physical Prototypes Because an analytical prototype is mathematical approximation of the product it will generally contain parameters that can be varied in order to represent range of design alternatives In most cases changing parameter in an analytical prototype is easier than changing an attribute of physical prototype For example consider an analytical prototype of the PackBot drivetrain that includes set of equations representing the electric motor One of the parameters in the mathematical model of the motor is the stall torque Varying this parameter and then solving the equations is much easier than changing an actual motor in physical prototype In most cases the analytical prototype not only is easier to change than physical prototype but also allows larger changes than could be made in physical prototype For this reason an analytical prototype frequently precedes physical prototype The analytical prototype is used to narrow the range of feasible parameters and then the physical prototype is used to fine tune or confirm the design See Chapter 15 Robust Design for detailed example of the use of an analytical prototype to explore several design parameters Physical Prototypes Are Required to Detect Unanticipated Phenomena physical prototype often exhibits unanticipated phenomena completely unrelated to the original objective of the prototype One reason for these surprises is that all of298 Chapter 14 the laws of physics are operating when the team experiments with physical prototypes Physical prototypes intended to investigate purely geometric issues will also have thermal and optical properties Some of the incidental properties of physical prototypes are irrelevant to the final product and act as annoyances during testing However some of these incidental properties of physical prototypes will also manifest themselves in the final product In these cases physical prototype can serve as tool for detecting unanticipated detrimental phenomena that may arise in the final product For example in pull test of various PackBot gripper finger coatings the team discovered that some of the coatings with good grip characteristics had poor durability Analytical prototypes in contrast can never reveal phenomena that are not part of the underlying analytical model on which the prototype is based For this reason at least one physical prototype is almost always built in product development effort Prototype May Reduce the Risk of Costly Iterations Exhibit 14 illustrates the role of risk and iteration in product development In many situations the outcome of test may dictate whether development task will have to be Probability of success 70 Build Injection Mold Probability of iteration 30 Conventional Process Probability Probability of success of success 70 95 Build Prototype Part Build Injection Mold Probability Probability of iteration of iteration 30 05 Process with Prototyping EXHIBIT prototype may reduce the risk of costly iteration Taking time to build and test prototype may allow the development team to detect problem that would otherwise not have been detected until after costly development activity such as building an injection mold Prototyping 299 repeated For example if molded part fits poorly with its mating parts the mold tooling may have to be rebuilt In Exhibit 14 30 percent risk of returning to the mold building activity after testing part fit is represented with an arrow labeled with probability of 30 If building and testing prototype substantially increases the likelihood that the subsequent activities will proceed without iteration from 70 percent to 95 percent as indicated in Exhibit 14 the prototype phase may be justified The anticipated benefits of prototype in reducing risk must be weighed against the time and money required to build and evaluate the prototype This is particularly important for comprehensive prototypes Products that are high in risk or uncertainty because of the high costs of failure new technology or the revolutionary nature of the product will benefit from such prototypes On the other hand products for which failure costs are low and the technology is well known do not derive as much riskreduction benefit from prototyping Most products fall between these extremes Exhibit 14 10 represents the range of situations that can be encountered in different types of development projects Analytical prototypes used any compre_ enslve extensively prototypes bUII Carefully planned compreI hensive prototypes Examples Sometimes the first unit built software consumer products is actually sold Examples airplanes satellites automobiles Ta One prototype may be Few or no comprehenswe built for verification prototypes built Examples Examples printed goods commercial buildings ships Low High Cost of Comprehensive Prototype Time or Money EXHIBIT The use of comprehensive prototypes depends on the relative level of technical or market risk and the cost of building comprehensive prototype 300 Chapter 14 Conventional Process Part Design Mold Design Mold Fabrication Part Design Prototype Mold Design Mold Fabrication Process with Prototyping Time EXHIBIT Role of prototype in expediting another step Taking time to build prototype may enable more rapid completion of subsequent step Prototype May Expedite Other Development Steps Sometimes the addition of short prototyping phase may allow subsequent activity to be completed more quickly than if the prototype were not built If the required additional time for the prototype phase is less than the savings in duration of the subsequent activity then this strategy is appropriate One of the most common occurrences of this situation is in mold design as illustrated in Exhibit 14 11 The existence of physical model of geometrically complex part allows the mold designer to more quickly visualize and design the mold tooling Conventional Process System PC Board Software System Assembly Design Fabrication Test and Test Process with Prototyping System PC Board System Assembly Design Fabrication and Test Prototype Software Circuit Board Test EXHIBIT Use of prototype to remove task from the critical path Prototyping 301 Prototype May Restructure Task Dependencies The top part of Exhibit 14 12 illustrates set of tasks that are completed sequentially It may be possible to complete some of the tasks concurrently by building prototype For example software test may depend on the existence of physical circuit Rather than waiting for the production version of the printed circuit board to use in the test the team may be able to rapidly fabricate prototype hand built board and use it for the test while the production of the printed circuit board proceeds Prototyping Technologies Hundreds of different production technologies are used to create prototypes particularly physical prototypes Two technologies have emerged as particularly important in the past 20 years three dimensional computer modeling 3D CAD and free form fabrication 3D CAD Modeling and Analysis Since the 1990s the dominant mode of representing designs has shifted dramatically from drawings often created using computer to 3D computer aided design models known as 3D CAD models 3D CAD models represent designs as collections of 3D solid entities each usually constructed from geometric primitives such as cylinders blocks and holes The advantages of 3D CAD modeling include the ability to easily visualize the three dimensional form of the design the ability to create photo realistic images for assessment of product appearance the ability to automatically compute physical properties such as mass and volume and the efficiency arising from the creation of one and only one canonical description of the design from which other more focused descriptions such as cross sectional views and fabrication drawings can be created Through the use of computer aided engineering CAE tools 3D CAD models have begun to serve as analytical prototypes In some settings this can eliminate one or more physical prototypes When 3D CAD models are used to carefully plan the final integrated assembly of the product and to detect geometric interference among parts this may indeed eliminate the need for full scale prototype For example in the development of the Boeing 777 and 787 jets the development teams were able to avoid building full scale wooden prototype models of the planes which had historically been used to detect geometric interferences among structural elements and the components of various other systems such as hydraulic lines Using 3D CAD model of an entire product in this manner is known depending on the industry setting as digital mock up digital prototype or virtual prototype 3D CAD models are also the underlying representation for many types of computerbased analyses Forms of CAE include finite element analysis of thermal flow or stress distribution virtual crash testing of automobiles kinematic and dynamic motion of complex mechanisms all of which have become more sophisticated every year In the PackBot development engineers conducted finite element analysis of structural integrity to understand impact stresses at various drop and crash angles Exhibit 14 13 shows one such analytical result based on 3D CAD model of the PackBot Engineers also computed heat flows and thermal dissipation performance using finite element analysis based on 3D CAD models 302 Chapter 14 Courtesy of iRobot Corp EXHIBIT Finite element analysis of the PackBot side plate based on 3D CAD model The image shows the stress distribution upon side impact at the rear wheel Free Form Fabrication In 1984 the first commercial free form fabrication system was introduced by 3D Systems This technology called stereolithography and dozens of competing technologies that followed it create physical objects directly from 3D CAD models and can be thought of as three dimensional printing This collection of technologies is often called rapid prototyping Most of the technologies work by constructing an object one cross sectional layer at time by depositing material or by using laser to selectively solidify liquid or powder The resulting parts are most often made from plastics but other materials are available including wax paper ceramics and metals In some cases the parts are used directly for visualization or in working prototypes However the parts are often used as patterns to make molds or patterns from which parts with particular material properties can then be molded or cast Free form fabrication technologies enable realistic 3D prototypes to be created earlier and less expensively than was possible before When used appropriately these prototypes can reduce product development time and or improve the resulting product quality In addition to enabling the rapid construction of working prototypes these technologies can be used to embody product concepts quickly and inexpensively increasing the ease with which concepts can be communicated to other team members senior managers development partners or potential customers For example the PackBot prototype shown in Exhibit l4 was made of components fabricated using stereolithography in only four days Prototyping 303 Planning for Prototypes potential pitfall in product development is what Clausing called the hardware swamp Clausing 1994 The swamp is caused by misguided prototyping efforts that is the building and debugging of prototypes physical or analytical that do not substantially contribute to the goals of the overall product development project One way to avoid the swamp is to carefully define each prototype before embarking on an effort to build and test it This section presents four step method for planning each prototype during product development project The method applies to all types of prototypes focused comprehensive physical and analytical template for recording the information generated from the method is given in Exhibit 14 14 We use the PackBot wheel prototype and impact test shown in Exhibit 14 as an example to illustrate the method Step Define the Purpose of the Prototype Recall the four purposes of prototypes learning communication integration and milestones In defining the purpose of prototype the team lists its specific learning and communication needs Team members also list any integration needs and whether or not the prototype is intended to be one of the major milestones of the overall product development project For the wheel prototypes the purpose was to determine the shock absorption characteristics and robustness of the wheels using various geometry and materials While these learning prototypes were primarily focused on performance the team was also considering the manufacturing cost of the materials some of which were not moldable and must be machined Name of Prototype PackBot Wheel Geometry Impact Test Purpose Select final wheel spoke geometry and materials based on strength and shock absorption characteristics Confirm that wheels absorb shock to withstand impact and protect the PackBot and its payload Level of Approximation Correct wheel spoke geometry materials and platform load Experimental Plan Build 12 test wheels using six different materials each with two spoke shapes Mount the wheels to the test fixture Conduct impact tests at range of drop heights Schedule August select wheel designs and materials August complete design of test fixture 14 August wheels and test fixture constructed 15 August assembly completed 23 August testing completed 25 August analysis of test results completed Courtesy of iRobot Corp EXHIBIT Planning template for the PackBot wheel geometry impact test prototypes 304 Chapter 14 Step Establish the Level of Approximation of the Prototype Planning prototype requires definition of the degree to which the final product is to be approximated The team should consider whether physical prototype is necessary or whether an analytical prototype would best meet its needs In most cases the best prototype is the simplest prototype that will serve the purposes established in step In some cases an earlier model serves as testbed and may be modified for the purposes of the prototype In other cases an existing prototype or prototype being built for another purpose can be utilized For the wheel prototype the team decided that materials and geometry of the wheel were critical attributes related to impact performance so the prototype needed to be constructed carefully with these attributes in mind However other aspects of the wheel could be ignored including the production method molding versus machining the attachment to the drive system and the track belt and the color and overall appearance of the wheel member of the team had previously explored an analytical model of the wheel spoke bending performance and felt that the physical prototype was necessary to verify her analysis She had discovered that there was basic trade off between shock absorption which required more flexible spokes and strength of the wheel which required larger spokes The team used the analytical prototype to determine the wheel spoke dimensions that would be investigated with the physical prototype Step Outline an Experimental Plan In most cases the use of prototype in product development can be thought of as an experiment Good experimental practice helps ensure the extraction of maximum value from the prototyping effort The experimental plan includes the identification of the variables of the experiment if any the test protocol an indication of what measurements will be performed and plan for analyzing the resulting data When many variables must be explored efficient experiment design greatly facilitates this process Chapter 15 Robust Design discusses design of experiments in detail For the wheel prototype tests the team decided to vary only the materials and web geometry of the spokes Based on the analytical models two spoke shapes were selected for testing Six different materials were also chosen for total of 12 test designs The team designed weighted platform to which each wheel could be mounted and test apparatus for dropping the platform at various heights They decided to instrument the platform to measure the acceleration forces transmitted through the wheels to the PackBot upon impact After each test they inspected the wheel for damage in the form of cracks or plastic deformation before increasing the test height These test results would not only be used to choose the best spoke geometry and material but also to improve the analytical model for future use which may eliminate further physical prototyping of modified wheel designs Step Create Schedule for Procurement Construction and Testing Because the building and testing of prototype can be considered subproj ect within the overall development project the team benefits from schedule for the prototyping activity Three dates are particularly important in defining prototyping effort First the team defines when the parts will be ready to assemble This is sometimes called the bucket of parts date Second the team defines the date when the prototype will first be tested Prototyping 305 This is sometimes called the smoke test date because it is the date the team will first apply power and look for smoke in products with electrical systems Third the team defines the date when it expects to have completed testing and produced the final results For the wheel prototypes no assembly was involved so when parts were available the prototypes could be assembled and tested rather quickly The team planned for eight days of testing and two days of analysis Planning Milestone Prototypes The above method for planning prototype applies to all prototypes including those as simple as the wheel geometry and those as complex as the beta prototype of the entire PackBot Nevertheless the comprehensive prototypes team uses as development milestones benefit from additional planning This planning activity typically occurs in conjunction with the overall product development planning activity at the end of the concept development phase In fact planning the milestone dates is an integral part of establishing an overall product development project plan See Chapter 18 Managing Projects All other things being equal the team would prefer to build as few milestone prototypes as possible because designing building and testing comprehensive prototypes consumes great deal of time and money However in reality few highly engineered products are developed with fewer than two milestone prototypes and many efforts require four or more As base case the team should consider using alpha beta and preproduction prototypes as milestones The team should then consider whether any of these milestones can be eliminated or whether in fact additional prototypes are necessary Alpha prototypes are typically used to assess whether the product works as intended The parts in alpha prototypes are usually similar in material and geometry to the parts that will be used in the production version of the product but they are usually made with prototype production processes For example plastic parts in an alpha prototype may be machined or rubber molded instead of injection molded as they would be in production Beta prototypes are typically used to assess reliability and to identify remaining bugs in the product These prototypes are often given to customers for testing in the intended use environment The parts in beta prototypes are usually made with actual production processes or supplied by the intended component suppliers but the product is usually not assembled with the intended final assembly facility or tooling For example the plastic parts in beta prototype might be molded with the production injection molds but would probably be assembled by technician in prototype shop rather than by production workers or automated equipment Preproduction prototypes are the first products produced by the entire production process At this point the production process is not yet operating at full capacity but is making limited quantities of the product These prototypes are used to verify production process capability are subjected to further testing and are often supplied to preferred customers Preproduction prototypes are sometimes called pilot production prototypes The most common deviations from the standard prototyping plan are to eliminate one of the standard prototypes or to add additional early prototypes Eliminating prototype usually the alpha may be possible if the product is very similar to other products306 Chapter 14 the firm has already developed and produced or if the product is extremely simple Additional early prototypes are common in situations where the product embodies new concept or technology These early prototypes are sometimes called experimental or engineering prototypes They usually do not look like the final product and many of the parts of the prototype are not designed with the intention of eventually being produced in quantity Once preliminary decisions have been made about the number of prototypes their characteristics and the time required to assemble and test them the team can place these milestones on the overall time line of the project When the team attempts to schedule these milestones the feasibility of the overall product development schedule can be assessed Frequently team will discover when working backward from the target date for the product launch that the assembly and test of one milestone prototype overlaps or is perilously close to the design and fabrication of the next milestone prototype If this overlapping happens in practice it is the worst manifestation of the hardware swamp When prototyping phases overlap there is little transfer of learning from one prototype to the next and the team should consider omitting one or more of the prototypes to allow the remaining prototypes to be spread out more in time During project planning overlapping prototyping phases can be avoided by beginning the project sooner delaying product launch eliminating milestone prototype or devising way to accelerate the development activities preceding each prototype See Chapter 18 Managing Projects for some techniques for achieving this acceleration Summary Product development almost always requires the building and testing of prototypes prototype is an approximation of the product on one or more dimensions of interest Prototypes can be usefully classified along two dimensions the degree to which they are physical as opposed to analytical and the degree to which they are comprehensive as opposed to focused Prototypes are used for learning communication integration and milestones While all types of prototypes can be used for all of these purposes physical prototypes are usually best for communication and comprehensive prototypes are best for integration and milestones Several principles are useful in guiding decisions about prototypes during product development Analytical prototypes are generally more flexible than physical prototypes Physical prototypes are required to detect unanticipated phenomena prototype may reduce the risk of costly iterations prototype may expedite other development steps prototype may restructure task dependencies 3D CAD modeling and free form fabrication technologies have reduced the relative cost and time required to create and analyze prototypes Prototyping 307 four step method for planning prototype is Define the purpose of the prototype Establish the level of approximation of the prototype Outline an experimental plan Create schedule for procurement construction and testing Milestone prototypes are defined in the product development project plan The number of such prototypes and their timing is one of the key elements of the overall development plan References and Bibliography Many current resources are available on the Internet via www rich eppinger net Clausing describes some of

function and form is difficult in the early phases of development What are the strengths and weaknesses of this approach For what types of products might this approach be dangerous Prototyping 309 Today there are several technologies able to create physical parts directly from 3D CAD files stereolithography and selective laser sintering How might team use such rapid prototyping technologies during the concept development phase of the product development process Might these technologies facilitate identifying customer needs establishing specifications generating product concepts selecting product concepts and or testing product concepts Some companies have reportedly abandoned the practice of doing customer test with the early prototypes of their products preferring instead to go directly and quickly to market in order to observe the actual customer response For what types of products and markets might this practice make sense Is drawing physical or an analytical prototype Microsoft uses frequent comprehensive prototypes in its development of software In fact in some projects there is daily build in which new version of the product is integrated and compiled every day Is this approach only viable for software products or could it be used for physical products as well What might be the costs and benefits of such an approach for physical products CHAPTER FIFTEEN
