 5354 Chapter Xerox Corporation is global enterprise offering wide array of document related products services and business solutions Its mission is to be the leader in the global document market providing document solutions that enhance business productivity key element of Xerox competitive strategy is to exploit technological innovation in rapidly changing market Pursuing this strategy requires the ability to choose the right set of development projects and to define the scope of these projects in such way that the projects are complementary Exhibit is photo of the Xerox Document Centre 265 product resulting from Xerox project code named Lakes The product planning process takes place before product development project is formally approved before substantial resources are applied and before the larger development team is formed Product planning is an activity that considers the portfolio of projects that an organization might pursue and determines what subset of these projects will be pursued over what time period The product planning activity ensures that product development projects support the broader business strategy of the company and addresses these questions What product development projects will be undertaken What mix of fundamentally new products platforms and derivative products should be pursued How do the various projects relate to each other as portfolio What will be the timing and sequence of the projects Each of the selected projects is then completed by product development team The team needs to know its mission before beginning development The answers to these critical questions are included in mission statement for the team What market segments should be considered in designing the product and developing its features What new technologies if any should be incorporated into the new product What are the manufacturing and service goals and constraints What are the financial targets for the project What are the budget and time frame for the project This chapter explains how an organization can maximize the effectiveness of its product development efforts by first considering the set of potential projects it might pursue deciding which projects are most desirable and then launching each project with focused mission We present five step planning process beginning with the identification of opportunities and resulting in mission statement for the project team The Product Planning Process The product plan identifies the portfolio of products to be developed by the organization and the timing of their introduction to the market The planning process considers product development opportunities identified by many sources including suggestions from marketing research customers current product development teams and benchmarking of competitors From among these opportunities portfolio of projects is chosen timing ofNew Platforms Derivatives Improvements Fundamentally New Product Planning 55

divides projects into four categories new platforms derivatives of existing platforms product improvements and fundamentally new products projects is outlined and resources are allocated Exhibit is an example of product plan listing products to be developed and indicating the time frame for each The product plan is regularly updated to reflect changes in the competitive environment changes in technology and information on the success of existing products Product plans are developed with the company goals capabilities constraints and competitive environment in mind Product planning decisions generally involve the senior management of the organization and may take place only annually or few times each year Some organizations have director of planning who manages this process Organizations that do not carefully plan the portfolio of development projects to pursue are often plagued with inefficiencies such as Inadequate coverage of target markets with competitive products Poor timing of market introductions of products Mismatches between aggregate development capacity and the number of projects pursued Poor distribution of resources with some projects overstaffed and others understaffed Initiation and subsequent cancellation of ill conceived projects Frequent changes in the directions of projects Four Types of Product Development Projects Product development projects can be classified as four types New product platforms This type of project involves major development effort to create new family of products based on new common platform The new product family would address familiar markets and product categories The Xerox Lakes project aimed at the development of new digital copier platform is an example of this type of project 56 Chapter Derivatives of existing product platforms These projects extend an existing product platform to better address familiar markets with one or more new products To develop new copier based on an existing light lens not digital product platform would be an example of this type of project Incremental improvements to existing products These projects may only involve adding or modifying some features of existing products in order to keep the product line current and competitive slight change to remedy minor flaws in an existing copier product would be an example of this type of proj ect Fundamentally new products These projects involve radically different product or production technologies and may help to address new and unfamiliar markets Such projects inherently involve more risk however the long term success of the enterprise may depend on what is learned through these important projects The first digital copier Xerox developed is an example of this type of project The Process Exhibit illustrates the steps in the product planning process First multiple opportunities are prioritized and set of promising projects is selected Resources are allocated to these projects and they are scheduled These planning activities focus on portfolio of opportunities and potential projects and are sometimes referred to as portfolio management aggregate product planning product line planning or product management Once projects have been selected and resources allocated mission statement is developed for each project The formulation of product plan and the development of mission statement therefore precede the actual product development process Although we show the planning process as essentially linear the activities of selecting promising projects and allocating resources are inherently iterative The realities of schedules and budgets often force reassessment of priorities and further refinement and culling of potential projects The product plan is therefore reevaluated frequently and should be modified based on the latest information from development teams research laboratories production marketing and service organizations People involved later in the process are often the first to realize that something about the overall plan or project mission is inconsistent infeasible or out of date The ability to adjust the product plan over time is vital to the long term success of the enterprise Multiple Projects Evaluate and ______ Allocate Complete Product Prioritize Resou rces and Pre Project Projects Portfolioof PlanTiming Product Planning Mission Projects Plan Statements Identify Opportunities Development Process EXHIBIT The product planning process These activities address portfolio of product development projects resulting in product plan and for each selected project mission statement Product Planning 57 To develop product plan and project mission statements we suggest five step process Identify opportunities Evaluate and prioritize projects Allocate resources and plan timing Complete pre project planning 59P Reflect on the results and the process Step Identify Opportunities The planning process begins with the identification of product development opportunities Such opportunities may involve any of the four types of projects defined above This step can be thought of as the opportunity funnel because it brings together inputs from across the enterprise Opportunities may be collected passively but we also recommend that the firm explicitly attempt to generate opportunities Chapter Opportunity Identification provides process for generating recognizing and evaluating opportunities When employed actively the opportunity funnel collects ideas continuously and new product opportunities may arise at any time As way of tracking sorting and refining these opportunities we recommend that each promising opportunity be described in short coherent statement and that this information be collected in database Several Web based idea management systems are available for gathering and storing information on opportunities although simple list in spreadsheet may be sufficient At Xerox many opportunities had been gathered and discussed Some were simple enhancements to existing products and others were proposals for products based on entirely new technologies Following are some examples of opportunity statements similar to those proposed at Xerox Create document distribution system in which networked printing device resides on each office worker desk and automatically delivers mail and other documents Create document delivery software that allows the digital delivery and storage of most intraorganizational documents via worker personal computer This opportunity statement eventually became the Lakes project Develop new black and white digital networkable document center platform for the office market including scanning storage fax distribution and printing capabilities Step Evaluate and Prioritize Projects If managed actively the opportunity funnel can collect hundreds or even thousands of opportunities during year Some of these opportunities do not make sense in the context of the firm other activities and in most cases there are simply too many opportunities for the firm to pursue at once The second step in the product planning58 Chapter process is therefore to select the most promising projects to pursue Four basic perspectives are useful in evaluating and prioritizing opportunities for new products in existing product categories competitive strategy market segmentation technological trajectories and product platforms After discussing these four perspectives we then discuss evaluating opportunities for fundamentally new products and how to balance the portfolio of projects Competitive Strategy An organization competitive strategy defines basic approach to markets and products with respect to competitors The choice of which opportunities to pursue can be guided by this strategy Most firms devote much discussion at senior management levels to their strategic competencies and the ways in which they aim to compete Several strategies are possible such as Technology leadership To implement this strategy the firm places great emphasis on basic research and development of new technologies and on the deployment of these technologies through product development Cost leadership This strategy requires the firm to compete on production efficiency either through economies of scale use of superior manufacturing methods low cost labor or better management of the production system Design for manufacturing methods see Chapter 11 are therefore emphasized in the product and process development activities under this strategy Customer focus To follow this strategy the firm works closely with new and existing customers to assess their changing needs and preferences Carefully designed product platforms facilitate the rapid development of derivative products with new features or functions of interest to customers This strategy may result in broad product line featuring high product variety in order to address the needs of heterogeneous customer segments Imitative This strategy involves closely following trends in the market allowing competitors to explore which new products are successful for each segment When viable opportunities have been identified the firm quickly launches new products to imitate the successful competitors fast development process is essential to effectively implement this strategy At Xerox strategic discussions centered around how the company would participate in the digital revolution of the office associated with growth of the Internet Xerox believed that the Internet would enable paradigm shift in business practices from one of print and then distribute to one of distribute and then print The Lakes project would need to support this corporate vision Market Segmentation Customers can be usefully thought of as belonging to distinct market segments Dividing market into segments allows the firm to consider the actions of competitors and the strength of the firm existing products with respect to each welldefined group of customers By mapping competitors products and the firm ownDepartment Workgroup Market Segments Personal Product Planning 59 Lakes Project 40 ppm Extensions 16k 25 ppm FEE

product line and which exploit weaknesses in the offerings of competitors Exhibit shows product segment map of this type for some Xerox products in which markets are segmented according to the number of users sharing office equipment Technological Trajectories In technology intensive businesses key product planning decision is when to adopt new basic technology in product line For example in the document business the key technological issue at the turn of the century was the shift to digital image processing and printing The product planning decision was when to develop digital products as opposed to developing another product based on light lens technology Technology curves are conceptual tool to help think about such decisions The technology curve displays the performance of the products in product category over time usually with respect to single performance variable such as resolution speed or reliability The curve illustrates basic but important concept Technologies evolve from initial emergence when performance is relatively low through rapid growth in performance based on experience and finally approach maturity where some natural60 Chapter Copier Product Performance Digital Technology Light Lens Technology Today Time EXHIBIT This technology curve illustrates that Xerox believed digital copier technologies were just emerging and would improve product performance in the coming years Xerox believed that it could develop full featured digital copier in the near future with performance exceeding that of light lens copiers technological limit is reached and the technology may become obsolete The shaped trajectory captures this general dynamic as shown in Exhibit The horizontal axis may be cumulative research and development effort or time the vertical axis may be performance cost ratio or any important performance dimension While curves characterize technological change remarkably well in wide variety of industries it is often difficult to predict the future trajectory of the performance curve how near or far is the ultimate performance limit Product Platform Planning The product platform is the set of assets shared across set of products Components and subassemblies are often the most important of these assets An effective platform can allow variety of derivative products to be created more rapidly and easily with each product providing the features and functions desired by particular market segment See Chapter 10 Product Architecture for more discussion of the underlying architecture enabling the product platform and for platform planning method Since platform development projects can take from to 10 times as much time and money as derivative product development projects firm cannot afford to make every project new platform Exhibit illustrates the leverage of an effective product platform The critical strategic decision at this stage is whether project will develop derivative product from an existing platform or develop an entirely new platform DecisionsResearch and Technology Development Platform Product Development Derivative Product Development Product Planning 61 Legend Platform Platform Project Product Release Time EXHIBIT platform development project creates the architecture of family of products Derivative products may be included in the initial platform development effort Platform or derivative products may follow thereafter Platform about product platforms are very closely related to the technology development efforts of the firm and to decisions about which technologies to employ in new products One technique for coordinating technology development with product planning is the technology roadmap technology roadmap is way to represent the expected availability and future use of various technologies relevant to the product being considered This method has been used by Motorola Philips Xerox and other leaders in fast moving high technology industries The method is particularly useful for planning products in which the critical functional elements are well known in advance To create technology roadmap multiple generations of technologies are labeled and arranged along time line as shown in Exhibit The technology roadmap can be augmented with the timing of projects and projects that would utilize these technological developments This is sometimes then called product technology roadmap The result is diagram showing product key functional elements and the sequence of technologies expected to implement these elements over given period of time Technology roadmapping can serve as planning tool to create joint strategy between technology development and product development Evaluating Fundamentally New Product Opportunities In addition to new versions of products in existing product categories the firm faces many opportunities in either new markets or fundamentally new technologies While investing scarce resources in the development of products using new technologies or for new markets is quite risky some such investments are necessary to periodically62 Chapter Functional Elements Technologies Photo Cylindrical Pitch Belt Pitch Belt receptor Drum

product For the Lakes platform Xerox selected technologies for critical functions that could be extended to the higher speeds and color capability required of its derivative products rejuvenate the product portfolio Christensen 1997 Some criteria for evaluating fundamentally new product opportunities include Market size units year average price Market growth rate percent per year Competitive intensity number of competitors and their strengths Depth of the firm existing knowledge of the market Depth of the firm existing knowledge of the technology Fit with the firm other products Fit with the firm capabilities Research and Product Planning 63 Potential for patents trade secrets or other barriers to competition Existence of product champion within the firm While these criteria are particularly useful in evaluating fundamentally new product opportunities they also apply generally to evaluating any product opportunity These criteria can be used in simple screening matrix to evaluate the overall attractiveness and types of risk for any given opportunity Chapter Opportunity Identification includes the Real WinWorth it analysis for opportunities an example of criteria based evaluation Chapter Concept Selection describes screening matrices for selecting product concepts but this method is directly applicable to selecting product opportunities as well Balancing the Portfolio There are many methods to help managers manage an organization portfolio of development projects Several of these methods involve mapping the portfolio along useful dimensions so that managers may consider the strategic implications of their planning decisions Cooper et al 2001 describe nLunerous mapping approaches involving dimensions such as technical risk financial return market attractiveness and the like One particularly useful mapping suggested by Wheelwright and Clark 1992 plots the portfolio of projects along two specific dimensions the extent to which the project involves change in the product line and the extent to which the project involves change in production processes Exhibit Extent of Production Process Changes Technology New Next Single Tuning and No Development Core Generation Department Incremental Process Process Process Upgrade Changes Change New Breakthrough Core Development Product Projects Platform Next Generation Degelopment Product rajec Lakes Addition meet oo Family Derivative Product Minor Development Product Enhancement No Current Product Product Process Change Support Adapted from Wheelright and Clark 1992 EXHIBIT Product process change matrix The size of the circles indicates the relative cost of the development projects 64 Chapter illustrates this mapping called product process change matrix This perspective can be useful to illuminate imbalances in the portfolio of projects under consideration and in assessing the consistency between portfolio of projects and the competitive strategy For example firm may discover that it has identified essentially no breakthrough opportunities or that it has no projects aimed at incremental improvements to existing products There are no general procedures for deciding exactly what the portfolio should look like However the firm choice of competitive strategy should affect the shape of the product development portfolio For example firm pursuing low cost strategy would expect the portfolio to contain more production process improvement projects Firms following strategy requiring high product variety would need to develop many derivative products based upon existing platforms Firms implementing strategy based on technological superiority may need to have portfolio including more technology development and breakthrough projects in anticipation that not all of these risky projects will result in marketable new products Note that planning research and technology development activities is closely coupled to but generally outside the purview of the product planning process Step Allocate Resources and Plan Timing It is likely that the firm cannot afford to invest in every product development opportunity in its desired balanced portfolio of proj ects As timing and resource allocation are determined for the most promising projects too many projects will invariably compete for too few resources As result the attempt to assign resources and plan timing ahnost always results in return to the prior evaluation and prioritization step to prune the set of proj ects to be pursued Resource Allocation Many organizations take on too many projects without regard for the limited availability of development resources As result skilled engineers and managers are assigned to more and more projects productivity drops off dramatically projects take longer to complete products become late to the market and profits are lower Aggregate planning helps an organization make efficient use of its resources by pursuing only those projects that can reasonably be completed with the budgeted resources The Lakes project was only one of many projects proposed at Xerox However since Lakes involved the development of an entirely new platform this project was substantially larger than the other projects being considered at the time Any feasible portfolio of projects would be dominated by the resource demands of the Lakes platform development effort In fact for the managers at Xerox to find the resources necessary to execute Lakes many other projects had to be eliminated or postponed until engineers were finished working on Lakes Estimating the resources required for each of the projects in the plan by month quarter or year forces the organization to face the realities of finite resources In most cases the primary resource to be managed is the effort of the development staff usually expressed in person hours or person months Other critical resources may also require careful planning such as model shop facilities rapid prototyping equipment pilot production lines testing facilities and so on Estimates of required resources in each period can be compared with available resources to compute an overall capacity utilization ratio demand capacity as well as utilizations by resource types as shown in Exhibit Where utilization exceeds 100 percent there are not sufficient resources to execute all ofYear Year Year a5 a5 35 B09 gggg EC 53 E8 EC Em

achieved using simple spreadsheet method based on estimates of resource demands over time This example spreadsheet uses units of person years although smaller time units quarters or months are commonly used in practice The associated chart highlights Where capacity is insufficient to handle all of the projects 99 Suruunld 19712004466 Chapter the projects in the plan on schedule In fact to allow for contingencies and to enable responsiveness planned capacity utilization may be below 100 percent In the aggregate planning process an organization may find that it is in danger of overcommitting resources often by as much as 100 percent or more according to Wheelwright and Clark 1992 Therefore the organization must decide in the planning stage which projects are most important to the success of the firm and pursue those with adequate resources Other projects may need to be eliminated from the plan or shifted in time Project Timing Determining the timing and sequence of projects sometimes called pipeline management must consider number of factors including Timing of product introductions Generally the sooner product is brought to market the better However launching product before it is of adequate quality can damage the reputation of the firm Technology readiness The robustness of the underlying technologies plays critical role in the planning process proven robust technology can be integrated into products much more quickly and reliably Market readiness The sequence of product introductions determines whether early adopters buy the low end product and may trade up or whether they buy the high end product offered at high initial price Releasing improvements too quickly can frustrate customers who want to keep up on the other hand releasing new products too slowly risks lagging behind competitors Competition The anticipated release of competing products may accelerate the timing of development projects The Product Plan The set of projects approved by the planning process sequenced in time becomes the product plan as shown earlier in Exhibit The plan may include mix of fundamentally new products platform projects and derivative projects of varying size Product plans are updated on periodic basis perhaps quarterly or annually as part of the firm strategic planning activity Step Complete Pre Projeot Planning Once the project has been approved but before substantial resources are applied pre project planning activity takes place This activity involves small cross functional team of people often known as the core team The Lakes core team consisted of approximately 30 people representing wide range of technical expertise marketing manufacturing and service functions At this point the earlier opportunity statement may be rewritten as product vision statement The Lakes concept team began with the following product vision statement Develop networked mid range digital platform for imaging marking and finishing The objective defined by product vision statement may be very general It may not say which specific new technologies should be used nor does it necessarily specify the goals and constraints of functions such as production and service operations In orderEXHIBIT Mission statement for the Lakes project This document summarizes the direction to be followed by the product development team Many more details are appended to this mission statement including the environmental goals service objectives and specific technologies identified for use in the Lakes platform Product Planning 67 Mission Statement

Canada Output devices manufactured in Brazil Image processing engine manufactured in both the United States and Europe Stakeholders Purchasers and users Manufacturing operations Service operations Distributors and resellers to provide clear guidance for the product development organization generally the team formulates more detailed definition of the target market and of the assumptions under which the development team will operate These decisions are captured in mission statement summary of which is illustrated in Exhibit 10 Mission Statements The mission statement may include some or all of the following information Brief one sentence description of the product This description identifies the basic function of the product but avoids implying specific product concept It may in fact be the product vision statement Benefit proposition This element of the mission statement articulates the critical few reasons customer would buy the product To some extent this is hypothesis which will be validated during the concept development process Key business goals In addition to the project goals that support the corporate strategy these goals generally include goals for time cost and quality timing of the product introduction desired financial performance market share targets 68 Chapter Target market for the product There may be several target markets for the product This part of the mission statement identifies the primary market as well as any secondary markets that should be considered in the development effort Assumptions and constraints that guide the development effort Assumptions must be made carefully although they restrict the range of possible product concepts they help to maintain manageable project scope Information may be attached to the mission statement to document decisions about assumptions and constraints Stakeholders One way to ensure that many of the subtle development issues are addressed is to explicitly list all of the product stakeholders that is all of the groups of people who are affected by the product success or failure The stakeholder list begins with the end user the ultimate external customer and the external customer who makes the buying decision about the product Stakeholders also include the customers of the product who reside within the firm such as the sales force the service organization and the production departments The list of stakeholders serves as reminder for the team to consider the needs of everyone who will be influenced by the product Assumptions and Constraints In creating the mission statement the team considers the strategies of several functional areas within the firm Of the many possible functional strategies to consider the manufacturing service and environmental strategies had the largest influence on the Lakes project In fact these strategies guided the core technical developments of the product One could reasonably ask why manufacturing service and environmental strategies for example should be part of the mission statement for new product An alternative view is that decisions about these issues should arise from the customer needs for the new product and should not be determined in advance First for extremely complex projects like Lakes the design of the manufacturing system is project of similar magnitude to the design of the product itself As result the manufacturing facilities involved in the product need to be identified very early in the process Second some product requirements may not be derived strictly from customer needs For example most customers will not directly express need for low environmental impact However Xerox chose to adopt corporate policy of environmentally responsible design In such cases the mission statement should reflect such corporate objectives and constraints Following are some of the issues that Xerox considered in establishing assumptions and constraints for the Lakes project Manufacturing Even at this very preliminary stage it is important to consider the capabilities capacities and constraints of the manufacturing operations broad array of questions may be relevant including Which internal production facilities might be used to manufacture and assemble the product What key suppliers should be involved in the development and when Are the existing production systems capable of producing the new technologies that have been identified for the product For Lakes Xerox assumed that input devices would be manufactured at production sites in Canada output devices in Brazil and the digital image processing engine in both the United States and Europe Service In business where customer service and service revenue are critical to the success of the firm it is necessary to also state strategic goals for levels of serviceProduct Planning 69 quality Efforts to improve service include strategic commitment to designing products that contain few parts which can be serviced quickly For Lakes serviceability goals included reducing both the number of field replaceable modules required to fully service the machine and the time to install them by an order of magnitude Environment Many corporations today are developing new products with environmental sustainability in mind The Lakes concept team adopted Xerox first zero to landfill policy an aggressive goal even for leader in environmental design practices such as Xerox The stated goal was that no components from Lakes product should ever go to landfill All components would be either remanufacturable or recyclable or both No parts should be disposed of by customers The Lakes environmental design strategy also included an energy efficiency goal to be the most efficient machine in its class Staffing and Other Pre Project Planning Activities The pre project planning activity also generally addresses project staffing and leadership This may involve getting key members of the development staff to sign up for new project that is to agree to commit to leading the development of the product or of critical element of the product Budgets are also generally established during pre project planning For fundamentally new products budgets and staffing plans will be for the concept development phase of development only This is because the details of the project are highly uncertain until the basic concept for the new product has been established More detailed planning will occur when and if the concept is developed further Step Reflect on the Results and the Process In this final step of the planning and strategy process the team should ask several questions to assess the quality of both the process and the results Some suggested questions are Is the opportunity funnel collecting an exciting and diverse set of product opportunities Does the product plan support the competitive strategy of the firm Does the product plan address the most important current opportunities facing the firm Are the total resources allocated to product development sufficient to pursue the firm competitive strategy Have creative ways of leveraging finite resources been considered such as the use of product platforms joint ventures and partnerships with suppliers Does the core team accept the challenges of the resulting mission statement Are the elements of the mission statement consistent Are the assumptions listed in the mission statement really necessary or is the project overconstrained Will the development team have the freedom to develop the best possible product How can the product planning process be improved Because the mission statement is the handoff to the development team reality check must be performed before proceeding with the development process This early stage is the time to remedy known flaws lest they become more severe and expensive as the development process progresses 70 Chapter This chapter explains the product planning method as stepwise process largely for simplicity of the presentation However reflection and criticism of consistency and fit should be an ongoing process Steps in the process can and should be executed simultaneously to make sure that the many plans and decisions are consistent with one another and with the goals capabilities and constraints of the firm Summary Product planning is periodic process that considers the portfolio of product development projects to be executed Product planning involves five step process Identify opportunities Evaluate and prioritize projects Allocate resources and plan timing Complete pre proj ect planning Reflect on the results and the process The opportunity funnel collects possibilities for new product platforms enhancements and fundamentally new products from several sources within and outside the firm Potential product development projects are evaluated based on the organization competitive strategy technological trajectories and product platform plans balanced portfolio of
