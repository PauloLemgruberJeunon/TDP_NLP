353354 Chapter 17 product development team at Polaroid Corporation was in the midst of developing new photograph printer the CI 700 Exhibit 17 shows one of Polaroid color photo printers The CI 700 would produce instant full color photographs from digital images stored in computer The primary markets for the product are the graphic arts insurance and real estate industries During the CI 700 development the Polaroid product development team was faced with several decisions that it knew could have significant impact on the product profitability Should the team take more time for development in order to make the product available on multiple computer platforms or would delay in bringing the CI 700 to market be too costly Should the product use standard print media from Polaroid existing businesses or new and specialized premium quality print media Should the team increase development spending in order to increase the reliability of the CI 700 The product development team needed tools to help it make these and other development decisions This chapter presents an economic analysis method for supporting the decisions of product development teams The process consists of two types of analysis quantitative and qualitative The emphasis in this chapter is on quick approximate methods for supporting decision making within the project team Elements of Economic Analysis Quantitative Analysis There are several basic cash inflows revenues and cash outflows costs in the life cycle of successful new product Cash inflows come from product sales Cash outflows include spending on product and process development costs of production ramp up such as equipment purchases and tooling costs of marketing and supporting the product and ongoing production costs such as raw materials components and labor The cumulative cash inflows and outflows over the life cycle of typical successful product are presented schematically in Exhibit 17 Economically successful products are profitable that is they generate more cumulative inflows than cumulative outflows measure of the degree to which inflows are greater than outflows is the net present value NPV of the project or the value in today dollars of all of the expected future cash flows The quantitative part of the economic analysis method described in this chapter estimates the NPV of project expected cash flows The method uses NPV techniques because they are easily understood and used widely in business Appendix provides brief tutorial on NPV The value of quantitative analysis is not only in providing objective evaluations of projects and alternatives but also in bringing measure of structure and discipline to the assessment of product development projects Qualitative Analysis Quantitative analysis can capture only those factors that are measurable yet projects often have both positive and negative implications that are difficult to quantify Also Cumulative Inflow or Outflow Product Development Economics 355 Sales Revenues Time Development Cost Ramp up Costs Marketing and Support Costs Production Cost EXHIBIT Typical cash flows for successful new product quantitative analysis rarely captures the characteristics of dynamic and competitive environment The chief executive of major American corporation underscores this point ve had MBAs argue with me that capital expenditure is wrong because it doesn have payback within two or three years they ignore the fact that if we don make the move we ll fall behind the rest of our industry in four or five years Linder and Smith 1992 The method in this chapter uses qualitative analysis to capture some of these issues Our approach to qualitative analysis is to consider specifically the interactions between the project and the firm the market and the macroeconomic environment When Should Economic Analysis Be Performed Economic analysis which includes both quantitative and qualitative approaches is useful in at least two different circumstances Go no go milestones For example should we try to develop product to address this market opportunity Should we proceed with the implementation of selected concept Should we launch the product we have developed These decisions typically arise at the end of each phase of development 356 Chapter 17 Operational design and development decisions Operational decisions involve questions such as Should we spend 100 000 to hire an outside firm to develop this component in order to save two months of development time Should we launch the product in four months at unit cost of 450 or wait until six months when we can reduce the cost to 400 The analysis done at the beginning of project can usually be updated with current information so that it does not have to be created in its entirety each time Used in this way the analysis becomes one of the information systems the team uses to manage the development project Economic analysis can be carried out by any member of the development team In small companies the project leader or one of the members of the core project team will implement the details of the analysis In larger companies representative from finance or planning group may be appointed to assist the development team in performing the analysis We emphasize that even when someone with formal training in financial modeling takes responsibility for this analysis the entire team should fully understand the analysis and be involved in its formulation and use Economic Analysis Process We recommend the following four step method for the economic analysis of product development project Build base case financial model Perform sensitivity analysis to understand the relationships between financial success and the key assumptions and variables of the model Use the sensitivity analysis to understand project trade offs Consider the influence of the qualitative factors on project success The balance of this chapter is organized around these four steps Step Build Base Case Financial Model Constructing the base case model consists of estimating the timing and magnitude of future cash flows and then computing the NPV of those cash flows Estimate the Timing and Magnitude of Future Cash Inflows and Outflows The timing and magnitude of the cash flows is estimated by merging the project schedule with the project budget sales volume forecasts and estimated production costs The level of detail of cash flows should be coarse enough to be convenient to work with yet it should contain enough resolution to facilitate effective decision making The most basic categories of cash flow for typical new product development project are Development cost all remaining design testing and refinement costs up to production ramp up Ramp up cost Marketing and support cost EXHIBIT CI 700 project budgets sales volume forecasts and production costs 357 Product Development Economics Production cost Sales revenues Depending on the types of decisions the model will support greater levels of detail for one or more areas may be required More detailed modeling may consider these same five cash flows in greater detail or it may consider other flows Typical refinements include Breakdown of production costs into direct costs and indirect costs overhead Breakdown of marketing and support costs into launch costs promotion costs direct sales costs and service costs Inclusion of tax effects including depreciation and investment tax credits Tax effects are typically considered in even simple financial modeling For the sake of clarity however we omit the tax effects in our examples Inclusion of such miscellaneous inflows and outflows as working capital requirements cannibalization the impact of the new product on existing product sales salvage costs and opportunity costs The financial model we use in this chapter is simplified to include only the major cash flows that are typically considered in practice but conceptually it is identical to more complex models The numerical values of the cash flows come from budgets and other estimates obtained from the development team the manufacturing organization and the marketing organization Exhibit 17 shows the relevant financial estimates for the CI 700 These data have been disguised to protect Polaroid proprietary financial information For more detailed discussion of manufacturing costs see Chapter 13 Design for Manufacturing Note that all revenues and expenses to date are sunk costs and are irrelevant to NPV calculations The concept of sunk costs is reviewed in Appendix In order to complete the model the financial estimates must be merged with timing information This can be done by considering the project schedule and sales plan Exhibit 17 shows the project timing information in Gantt chart form for the CI 700 For most projects time increment of months or quarters is most appropriate The remaining time to market is estimated to be five quarters and product sales are anticipated to last 11 quarters common method of representing project cash flow is table The rows of the table are the different cash flow categories while the columns represent successive time periods Usually this table is encoded in computer spreadsheet to facilitate analysis For this example we assume that the rate of cash flow for any category is constant across any time period total development spending of million over one year is allocated equally to each of the four quarters however the values can be arranged in any way that best represents the team forecast of the cash flows We multiply the unit sales quantity Development cost million Ramp up cost million Marketing and support cost million year Unit production cost 400 unit Sales and production volume 20 000 units

cash flow table all dollar values are in thousands in this and subsequent tables by the unit price to find the total product revenues in each period We also multiply the unit production quantity by the unit production cost to find the total production cost in each period Exhibit 17 illustrates the resulting table Compute the Net Present Value of the Cash Flows Computing the NPV requires that the net cash flow for each period be determined and then that this cash flow be converted to its present value its value in today dollars as shown in Exhibit 17 Consider for example the calculations for

thousand dollars The Base Case Financial Model Can Support Go No Go Decisions and Major Investment Decisions The NPV of this project according to the base case model is positive so the model supports and is consistent with the decision to proceed with development Such modeling can also be used to support major investment decisions Say for example that Polaroid was deciding between two different production facilities with different ramp up production and support costs The team could develop model for each of the two scenarios and then compare the NPVs The scenario with the higher NPV would better support the investment decision We now consider sensitivity analysis as technique for readily understanding multiple scenarios for ongoing product development decisions Step Perform Sensitivity Analysis Sensitivity analysis uses the financial model to answer what if questions by calculating the change in NPV corresponding to change in the factors included in the model Both internal and external factors influence project value Internal factors are those over which the development team has large degree of influence including development program expense development speed production cost and product performance External factors are those that the team cannot arbitrarily change including the competitive360 Chapter 17 EXHIBIT Key factors influencing product development

model with 20 percent decrease in development spending environment market response actions of competitors sales volume and product price There may be disagreement over whether price is an internal or external factor In either case there is little disagreement that price is strongly influenced by the prices of competitive products and that it is coupled to sales volume While external factors are not directly controlled by product development teams they are often influenced by the internal factors The external and internal factors are shown in Exhibit 17 Development Cost Example As first example let us consider the sensitivity of NPV to changes in development cost By making incremental changes to development cost while holding other factors constant we can see the incremental impact on project NPV For example what will be the change in NPV if development cost is decreased by 20 percent 20 percent decrease would lower the total development spending from million to million If development time remains one year then the spending per quarter would decrease from 25 million to million This change is simply entered in the model and the resulting NPV is calculated This change to the CI 700 base case model is shown in Exhibit 17 Product Development Economics 361 Change in Development Cost 50 20 10 base 20 50 Development Change in Change in Cost Development Change in NPV NPV

cost sensitivities 20 percent decrease in development cost will increase NPV to 167 000 This represents dollar increase of 964 000 and percentage increase of 11 in NPV This is an extremely simple case we assume we can achieve the same project goals by spending million less on development and we therefore have increased the project value by the present value of the million in savings accrued over time period of one year The CI 700 development cost sensitivity analysis for range of changes is shown in Exhibit 17 The values in the table are computed by entering the changes corresponding to each scenario into the base case model and noting the results It is often useful to know the absolute dollar changes in NPV as well as the relative percentage changes so we show both in the sensitivity table Development Time Example As second example we calculate the development time sensitivities for the CI 700 model Consider the impact on project NPV of 25 percent increase in development time 25 percent increase in development time would raise the time from four quarters to five quarters This increase in development time would also delay the start of production ramp up marketing efforts and product sales To perform the sensitivity analysis we must make several assumptions about the changes We assume the same total amount of development cost even though we will increase the time period over which the spending occurs thus lowering the rate of spending from 25 million to million per quarter We also assume that there is fixed window for sales which starts as soon as the product enters the market and ends in the fourth quarter of year In effect we assume we can sell product from the time we are able to introduce it until fixed date in the future Note that these assumptions are unique to this development project Different product development projects would require different assumptions as appropriate For example we might have instead assumed that the sales window simply shifts in time by one quarter The change to the Cl 700 financial model is shown in Exhibit 17 10 Exhibit 17 11 presents the development time sensitivities for range of changes We can see that 25 percent increase in development time will decrease NPV to 764 000 This represents decrease in NPV of 439 000 or 17 percent We recommend that sensitivities be computed for each of the external and internal factors with the exception of the competitive environment which is not explicitly contained in the base case model These sensitivity analyses inform the team about which factors362 Chapter 17

sensitivities in the model have substantial influence on NPV This information is useful in helping the team understand which factors should be studied in more detail in order to refine and improve the base case model The information is also useful in supporting the operating decisions of the team as discussed in the next step Sensitivity analysis shows that NPV is highly dependent on uncertainties in some base case input values and less dependent on others In addition some of the input values used to compute the base case are more uncertain than others For example forecasted sales volume may be more uncertain than estimated unit production cost By assuming range of high and low values for any uncertain inputs in the financial analysis the team can compute range of possible values for NPV The high and low values can be thought of as defining the range within which the team is highly confident the actual outcomes will fall This analysis can be summarized in tornado chart showing the effect of each uncertainty on NPV For the CI 700 project key uncertainties include the range of input values given in Exhibit 17 12 Changing these inputs in the model one at time holding everything else

Analysis to Understand Project Trade Offs Why would product development team want to change the factors under its control For instance why should development time be increased if the change lowers the NPV of the project Typically the development team will make such change only if some other offsetting gain is expected such as better quality product with higher sales volumes We therefore need to understand the relative magnitude of these financial interactions 364 Chapter 17 EXHIBIT 17 14 Potential interactions between internally driven factors Adapted from Smith and Reinertsen 1997 Development Product Time Cost Product Development Performance Cost Six Potential Interactions Development teams attempt to manage six potential interactions between the internally driven factors These potential interactions are shown schematically in Exhibit 17 14 The potential interaction between any two internal factors depends on the characteristics of the specific product context In many cases the interactions are trade offs For example decreasing development time may lead to lower product performance Increased product performance may require additional product cost However some of these interactions are more complex than simple trade off For example decreasing product development time may require an increase in development spending yet extending development time may also lead to an increase in cost if the extension is caused by delay in critical task rather than by planned extension of the schedule In general these interactions are important because of the linkage between the internal factors and the external factors For example increasing development cost or time may enhance product performance and therefore increase sales volume or allow higher prices Decreasing development time may allow the product to reach the market sooner and thus increase sales volume While accurate modeling of externally driven factors price sales volume is often very difficult the quantitative model can nevertheless support decision making Recall from our initial examples that the CI 700 development team was considering increasing development spending in order to develop higher quality product which they hoped would lead to greater sales volume The quantitative model can support this decision by answering the question of how much the sales volume would have to increase to justify the additional spending on development We have calculated the sensitivity of NPV to changes in development cost see Exhibit 17 We can also calculate the sensitivity of NPV to changes in sales volume Exhibit 17 15 Say that the CI 700 development team is considering 10 percent increase in development cost From Exhibit 17 we found that this increase in spending will decrease NPV by percent Now what increase in volume would be necessary to at least compensate for the decrease in NPV From Exhibit 17 15 we know that 10 percent increase in sales volume would increase NPV by 21 percent It follows under assumptions of linearity that percent 21 summarize 10 percent increase in development cost would decrease NPV by percent percent increase in sales volume is needed to offset the drop While the increase in sales volume would increase NPV by percent ToProduct Development Economics 365 Change in Sales Volume 3O 20 10 base 20 30 Sales Change Change in Volume in Sales Change in NPV NPV

of the increased development spending on sales volume is not known the model does provide helpful guide for what magnitude of sales volume increase is needed to sustain particular increases in development cost Trade Off Rules The near linearity of many sensitivity analyses allows the team to compute some trade ofl rules to inform day to day decision making These rules take the form of the cost per unit change in the internal and external factors For example what is the cost of one month delay in development time What is the cost of 10 percent development budget overrun What is the cost of per unit increase in manufacturing cost The trade off rules are easily computed from the base case model and can be used to inform the team of the relative magnitude of the sensitivities of the project profitability on factors under its control Exhibit 17 16 contains the rules for the CI 700 The trade off rules inform the original questions posed in the chapter introduction The team decided that waiting for software that would allow the printer to be used with both Apple Macintosh and Microsoft Windows operating systems would delay product introduction by two months It was calculated that the delay would have an approximate cost of 960 000 Rather than wait the team reasoned that it could introduce the product before all printer drivers were available as long as the drivers were offered as soon as they were available The media development group at Polaroid estimated that the development of a366 Chapter 17 new print medium would cost more than million and would take at least one year The team decided that these time and budget penalties did not warrant the marginal increase in print size and quality that would be enabled by the new medium Finally the team felt that the reliability of the product could be dramatically improved with the addition of only one engineer and one technician to the team This additional cost was expected to be approximately 100 000 for the remainder of the project The team noted that they would have to increase sales by only percent to justify this investment Reliability was identified as key customer need and so the team chose to aggressively pursue increased reliability Limitations of Quantitative Analysis Financial modeling and sensitivity analysis are powerful tools for supporting product development decisions but these techniques have important limitations One school of thought believes that rigorous financial analyses are required to bring discipline and control to the product development process However detractors argue that quantitative analysis suffers from some of the following problems It focuses only on measurable quantities Quantitative techniques like NPV empha size and rely on that which is measurable However many critical factors impacting product development projects are difficult to measure accurately In effect quantitative techniques encourage investment in measurable assets and discourage investment in intangible assets It depends on validity of assumptions and data Product development teams may be lulled into sense of security by the seemingly precise result of an NPV calculation Financial analyses such as the ones we have shown in this chapter may seem to provide precise estimates of product development project value However such precision in no way implies accuracy We can develop highly sophisticated financial model of product development project that computes project NPV to the fifth decimal place yet if the assumptions and data of our model are not correct the value calculated will not be correct Consider the CI 700 development time sensitivity example assumption of fixed product sales window This assumption was useful but its integrity can easily be questioned Indeed different assumption could give dramatically different results Bureaucracy reduces productivity Detractors of financial analysis assert that such activities provide high level of planning and control at the expense of product development productivity According to detractors extensive planning and review guarantee that brilliantly conceived well engineered product will reach the market after its market window has already closed Detractors also argue that overzealously applied professional management techniques stifle the product development process Potentially productive development time is devoted to preparation of analyses and meetings The cumulative effect of this planning and review can be ballooning development process These concerns are generally quite valid However in our opinion they are largely as sociated with the blind application of the results of the quantitative analysis or arise from the combination of financial analysis with an already stifling bureaucracy We reject the notion that quantitative analysis should not be done just because problems can arise from the blind application of the results Rather development teams should understand theProduct Development Economics 367 strengths and limitations of the techniques and should be fully aware of how the models work and on what assumptions they are based Furthermore qualitative analysis as discussed in the next section can remedy some of the inherent weaknesses in the quantitative techniques Step Consider the Influence of the Qualitative Factors on Project Success EXHIBIT The broader context of development project Many factors influencing development projects are difficult to quantify because they are complex or uncertain We refer to such factors as qualitative factors After providing conceptual framework for qualitative analysis we use examples from the CI 700 to illustrate how the analysis is carried out Consider the following questions about the CI 700 project Will knowledge gained from the CI 700 development spill over and be of benefit to other Polaroid development projects How will competitors react to the introduction of the CI 700 Will competitors modify their own development efforts in response to Polaroid actions Will there be significant fluctuations in the dollar yen exchange rate that would change the cost of component parts Our quantitative model implicitly accounts for these and many other issues with several broad assumptions The model assumes that decisions made by the project team do not affect actions of groups external to the project or alternatively that the external forces do not change the team actions This important assumption of our model is common to many other financial models and is called the ceteris paribus other things being equal assumption Projects Interact with the Firm the Market and the Macro Environment Decisions made within project in general do have important consequences for the firm as whole for competitors and customers in the market and even for the macroeconomic macro environment in which the market operates Exhibit 17 17 Similarly events and actions outside of development project often significantly impact its value Qualitative analysis focuses largely on these interactions The most basic approach to qualitative analysis is to consider the interactions between the project and the firm as whole the interactions between the project and the market in which the product will be sold and the interactions between the project and the macro environment Macro Environment368 Chapter 17 Interactions between the Project and the Firm as Whole One assumption embedded in the quantitative model is that firm profit will be maximized if project profit is maximized However development decisions must be made in the context of the firm as whole The two key interactions between the project and the firm are externalities and strategic fit Externalities An extemality is an unpriced cost or benefit imposed on one part of the firm by the actions of second costs are known as negative externalities and benefits as positive externalities As an example of positive extemality development learning on one project may benefit other current or future projects but is paid for by the first project How should the other projects account for such benefits gained at no additional cost How should the first project account for resources spent that benefit not only itself but also other current or future projects Strategic fit Decisions of the development team must not only benefit the project but also be consistent with the firm overall product plan and technology strategy For example how well does proposed new product technology or feature fit with the firm resources and objectives Is it compatible with the firm emphasis on technical excellence Is it compatible with the firm emphasis on uniqueness Because of their complexity and uncertainty externalities and strategic fit are very difficult to quantify This does not mean these issues should not be considered rather they must be considered qualitatively See Chapter Product Planning for discussion of some strategic planning issues that cut across multiple projects Interactions between the Project and the Market We have modeled explicitly only price and volume as the key externally driven factors In effect we have held the actions and reactions of the market constant To model project value accurately we must relax the ceteris paribus assumption to recognize that development team decisions impact the market and that market events impact the development project The market environment is impacted by the actions of not only the development team but also three other groups Competitors Competitors may provide products in direct competition or products that compete indirectly as substitutes Customers Customers expectations incomes or tastes may change Changes may be independent or may be driven by new conditions in markets for complementary or substitute products Suppliers Suppliers of inputs to the new product are subject to their own markets competitive pressures These pressures may indirectly through the value chain impact the new product Actions and reactions of these groups most often impact expected price and volume but they can have second order effects as well For example consider new competitor that has rapid product development cycles and that seems to value market share rather than short term profitability Clearly the entrance of such new competitor would change our expected price and volume Further we may attempt to accelerate our own development efforts in response Thus the competitor actions may impact not only our sales volume forecasts but also our planned development schedule Product Development Economics 369 Interactions between the Project and the Macro Environment We must relax the ceteris paribus assumption to take into account key macro factors Major economic shifts Examples of typical major economic shifts that impact the value of development projects are changes in foreign exchange rates materials prices or labor costs Government regulations New regulations can destroy product development opportunity On the other hand shift in the regulatory structure of an industry can also spawn entire new industries Social trends As with government regulations new social concerns such as increased environmental awareness can also destroy existing industries or create new ones Macro factors can have important impacts on development project value However these effects are difficult to model quantitatively because of inherent complexity and uncertainty The product development team for the CI 700 faced many qualitative issues during development of the product We present three of the key qualitative issues that the Polaroid team encountered and describe the impacts of these issues on the project The examples illustrate not only the limitations of quantitative analysis but also the importance of qualitative analysis Carrying Out Qualitative Analysis For most project teams the most appropriate qualitative analysis method is simply to consider and discuss the interactions between the project and the firm the project and the market and the project and the macro environment Then the team considers these interactions in concert with the results of the quantitative analysis in order to determine the most appropriate relative emphasis on development speed development expense manufacturing cost and product performance We provide three examples below of the qualitative analysis for the Cl 700 While we believe this informal approach is most appropriate for decisions made at the level of the project team more structured techniques are available including strategic analysis game theory and scenario analysis techniques References for each of these techniques are included in the bibliography Example Decrease in the Price of Substitute Product Color laser printers are substitute product for the Cl 700 While color laser printers are more costly than the Cl 700 they limit the potential of the Cl 700 market by placing ceiling on the price Polaroid can charge During the Cl 700 development manufacturers of color laser printers achieved several important technological breakthroughs The advances allowed the manufacturers to offer color laser printers at significantly lower prices The Polaroid team was faced with change in the competitive environment that was caused by others and that invalidated fundamental assumptions of the financial model for the Cl 700 In this example it is clear that the CI 700 project cannot be considered in isolation The original sales volume forecasts incorporated implicit assumptions about the color laser printer market but the assumptions were invalidated by advances in color laser printer technology While the color laser printer breakthrough would have been difficult370 Chapter 17 to predict quantitative analysis helped the CI 700 development team understand the sensitivity of the value of the project to this development By using the model to estimate the sensitivity of NPV to changes in sales volume the team was able to quickly grasp the magnitude of the change in project value The combination of quantitative and qualitative analysis convinced the team to move more quickly and to further reduce the cost of the product for the project to remain viable Example Increased Competition in Complementary Product Market The demand for the CI 700 is closely linked to the prices of personal computers PCs PCs are said to be complementary products to the CI 700 because decrease in the price of PCs increases demand for the CI 700 Cheaper PCs both increase PC sales and allow buyers to afford additional peripheral products such as the CI 700 Thus decrease in the price of PCs would increase the value of the CI 700 project During the CI 700 development project intense competition in the PC market further increased with new entrants and rapid technological development The Polaroid team was faced with change in the competitive environment for their product Quantitative analysis helped the CI 700 development team understand how project value was impacted By using the model to estimate the sensitivity of NPV to changes in sales volume the team was able to quickly understand the magnitude of the change in project value which they hoped would partially offset the pressure from the falling prices for color printers Example The Option Value of Creating Good Platform Product The CI 700 was the first product of its kind produced by Polaroid and the development team recognized that many of their development decisions would impact potential future generations of the product line For example the ease with which future generation products could be built around the same basic technological platform depended upon design decisions made in the CI 700 project The team could choose to increase development spending and development time in order to facilitate the development of potential future generation products even if doing so would not make economic sense in the context of single product They chose however to push ahead quickly with the CI 700 without extreme efforts to accommodate future models The argument was that the future of the market was so uncertain that the risk of not getting to market in time outweighed the potential usefulness of the product as platform for future products Summary Product development teams must make many decisions in the course of development project Economic analysis is useful tool for supporting this decision making The method consists of four steps Build base case financial model Perform sensitivity analysis to understand the relationships between financial success and the key assumptions and variables of the model Use the sensitivity analysis to understand project trade offs Consider the influence of qualitative factors on project success Product Development Economics 371 Quantitative analysis using NPV techniques is practiced widely in business The technique forces product development teams to look objectively at their projects and their decisions At the very least they must go through the process of creating realistic project schedules and budgets Financial modeling provides method for quantitatively understanding the key profit drivers of the project Quantitative techniques such as financial modeling and analysis rest upon assumptions about the external environment This environment is constantly changing and may be influenced by development team decisions or by other uncontrollable factors Further quantitative analysis by its very nature considers only that which is measurable yet many key factors influencing the project are highly complex or uncertain and are thus difficult to quantify Qualitative analysis emphasizes the importance of such difficult to quantify issues by asking specifically what the interactions are between the project and the rest of the firm the market and the macro environment Together quantitative and qualitative techniques can help ensure that the team makes economically sound development decisions References and Bibliography Many current resources are available on the lntemet via www rich eppinger net Bayus

five reasons firms may choose to pursue product even if the quantitative analysis reveals negative NPV Build quantitative model to analyze the development and sale of bicycle light As sume that you could sell 20 000 units per year for five years at sales price wholesale of 20 per unit and manufacturing cost of 10 per unit Assume that production ramp up expenses would be 20 000 ongoing marketing and support costs would be 000 per month and development would take another 12 months How much development spending could such project justify Compute the trade off rules for the case described in Exercise Revise the tornado chart in Exhibit 17 13 to show the effect of an increase in development time Assume that the minimum change in development time is zero and the maximum change in development time is an increase of one quarter Thought Questions Can you think of successful products that never would have been developed if their creators had relied exclusively on quantitative financial model to justify their efforts Do these products share any characteristics One model of the impact of delay in product introduction is that sales are simply shifted later in time Another model is that some of the sales are pushed beyond the window of opportunity and are lost forever Can you suggest other models for the implications of an extension of product development time Is such an extension ever beneficial How would you use the quantitative analysis method to capture the economic per formance of an entire line of products to be developed and introduced over several years Product Development Economics 373 Appendix Time Value of Money and the Net Present Value Technique This appendix provides very basic tutorial on net present value for those who are unfamiliar with this concept Net present value NPV is an intuitive and powerful concept In essence NPV is simply recognition of the fact that dollar today is worth more than dollar tomorrow NPV calculations evaluate the value today present value of some future income or expense Say that bank will give an interest rate of percent per time period the time period could be month quarter or year long If we invest 100 today for one time period at an interest rate of percent how much will the bank pay out after one time period If we let be the interest rate and be the amount invested then the amount received after one time period is 08 100 08 100 108 Thus if we invest 100 for one time period at an interest rate of percent we will receive 108 at the end of the time period In other words 100 today is worth 108 received in the next time period Now let say that we have invested some amount for one time period at an interest rate Let also say that after the one time period the amount received back is 100 and the interest rate is percent How much then was invested originally We can find the original investment by doing the reverse of what we did in the previous example 100 100 100 100 08 08 92 59 Thus if we invest 92 59 for one time period at an interest rate of percent we will receive 100 at the end of the time period In other words 92 59 today is worth 100 received in the next time period We have just shown how dollar today is worth more than dollar tomorrow Of course 100 today is worth 100 But what is 100 received next time period worth in todays dollars The answer is 92 59 as we showed in the last example Stated another way the present value of 100 received in the next time period is 92 59 at discount rate of percent So present value is the value in today dollars of some income received or expense paid out in future period Now let look at the result of investing 100 at percent for longer periods One time period 08 100 108 Two time periods 100 08 100 116 64 Three time periods 100 08 100 125 97374 Chapter 17 As we did earlier let find the present value of three separate investments of 100 received after one two and three time periods One time period 100 fl 92 59 08 The present value of 100 received next time period is 92 59 Two time periods 100 mi 85 08 The present value of 100 received after two time periods is 85 73 Three time periods 100 100 79 38 08 The present value of 100 received after three time periods is 79 We found the present value of these three separate investments Let say instead that we had one investment that paid out 100 in each of time periods one two and three What would that investment be worth today The answer is simply the sum of the individual present values or 257 70 The sum of the present values is called the net present value or NPV NPV is the present value of all cash inflows and all cash outflows The present value of cash outflow is just the negative of cash inflow of the same amount We can summarize the present value calculation into convenient formula The present value PV of an amount received or paid out ttime periods from now is PV Some calculators have special present value function on them that can do the calculations quickly Most computer spreadsheet programs have special financial functions that automatically do the present value calculations The information required for these special functions is the future amount paid out the interest rate and the number of time periods of the investment What Interest Rate Should We Use The interest rate also called the discount rate discount factor or hurdle rate to use is our own or our company opportunity cost of capital It is called the opportunity cost of capital because it is the return forgone by investing in the project rather than in other investments Stated another way the discount factor is the reward that investors demand for accepting delayed payment project that has positive NPV must be earning more than the opportunity cost of capital and is thus good investment Note that many firms applyProduct Development Economics 375 constant hurdle rate to all their investment decisions In recent years most firms have been using discount factors of 10 to 20 percent Sunk Costs Are Irrelevant for Net Present Value Calculations In the context of product development decision making costs that have already been incurred are termed sunk costs Because sunk costs are past and irreversible outflows they cannot be affected by present or future decisions so they should be ignored for NPV calculations To clarify this point let consider an example of the familiar cut our losses argument We ve already spent over 600 million and nine years with no product to show for it and you want me to approve another 90 million That crazy While this type of argument might sound logical in fact the amount of money already spent is not important for the decision of whether or not to spend 90 million more What is important is how much extra profit will be gained from investing the additional 90 million Say that the expected profit from product sales is 350 million Let look at the NPV of the two options assume all numbers given are present values Cut Our Losses Invest 90 Million More Additional amount invested Additional amount invested 9O Profits from product sales Profits from product sales 350 NPV of cut losses decision NPV of invest decision 260 Total invested 600 Total invested 690 Total project return 600 Total project return 34O Because the invest decision has positive NPV the firm should proceed While it is clear that the firm will lose money on the project in either case the 600 million already spent is sunk cost and should not impact the invest or cut losses decision Of course the sunk cost argument is cold analytical perspective there is saying that sunk costs are only relevant to the manager who sunk them Project managers with long record of negative total project returns may find that sunk costs are extremely relevant to their ability to get support for future projects Appendix Modeling Uncertain Cash Flows Using Net Present Value Analysis Product development projects face many perils For example the team may think that the manufacturing cost for particular new product will be 40 per unit However the cost could be much higher or it might even be lower The team does not know for sure until the product is actually built The team may forecast sales for the new product but the forecasts depend on among other things when competitors get their versions to the market and this information will not be available until their products are actually introduced These uncertainties that are particular to project are called project Specific risks How376 Chapter 17 EXHIBIT situation in which two discrete scenarios can be envisioned should project specific risks be accounted for Some development teams increase the discount rate to offset uncertainty about the outcomes However such an arbitrary increment in the discount rate would be applied uniformly to both certain and uncertain cash flows Fortunately better approaches are available if the team is able to estimate the probabilities of uncertain cash flows Instead of using arbitrary adjustments to the discount rate development teams should strive for realistic forecasting of cash flows These forecasts can be supplemented with sensitivity analysis to understand the impact of the full range of possible outcomes for the uncertain factors Project specific risks should be considered only in the expected cash flows and not in the discount rate Sensitivity analysis can be performed by systematically varying the model parameters such as product price or manufacturing cost to understand how critically the net present value depends on specific values for these parameters basic analysis can be performed one variable at time as explained in the body of this chapter or combinations of variables can be adjusted to form realistic scenarios more sophisticated analysis can be performed using Monte Carlo simulation based on assumed probability distributions for the parameters in the model Note that there is second type of risk general market risk which is not specific to the project General market risk stems from the fact that there are economywide perils which threaten all businesses and projects Although entire books on calculating market risk have been written for our purposes it suffices to say that market risk is typically accounted for by inflating the discount rate Analyzing Scenarios Sometimes project teams face discrete scenarios that are clearly foreseeable and that will have direct and significant influence on the project outcome For example team may have filed patent application on novel and distinctive product concept If the patent is allowed then the team expects to face much less of competitive threat than if the patent is not allowed These two scenarios can be modeled as decision tree as shown in Exhibit 17 18 In this case there is not an explicit decision but rather an outcome of an uncertain process These diagrams are nevertheless called decision trees by convention The two branches of this tree represent the two scenarios the team envisions The present value of the project can be analyzed for each scenario taken independently The team can also assign probability to each scenario Given these inputs the team can now calculate the expected net present value for the project accounting for the two possible scenarios NPV Pa PVa Pb PVb wherePa Pb Patent Allowed PVa 500 000 Launch Product Patent not Allowed PVb 500 000Product Development Economics 377 For the situation depicted by the decision tree shown in Exhibit 17 18 NPV 60 500 000 40 500 000 500 000 This kind of analysis is appropriate when discrete and distinct scenarios can be envisioned and when these scenarios have substantially different cash flows Analyzing Scenarios with Decision Points When analyzing product development projects the team should recognize that most development projects can be discontinued or redirected based on the latest information available Such decision points may occur at the time of major milestones or reviews This flexibility to expand or contract project is financially valuable The notion of decision points with the ability to change an investment is the subject of an entire field of analysis called real options Copeland and Antikarov 2003 provide detailed treatment of this subject Here we provide way to think about scenarios containing decision points Consider the scenario depicted in Exhibit 17 19 team is contemplating the launch of product in an entirely new category which is an inherently risky type of project The team could just launch the project and hope for success or it could spend time and money testing the product in the marketplace If it invests in market testing the team may discover that the product is not viable in which case it has the option to cancel the project Alternatively it may discover that the market is highly responsive to the new product in which case it can launch with confidence and much higher associated expected value of the future cash flows As base case the team analyzes the value of just launching the product without investigation Given the team assessment of the likelihood of success the present value is million for this plan The value of market testing followed by decision to proceed or not can be analyzed as follows In this case the team spends an additional million for investigation After investigation there is 70 percent chance that the team will launch the product and reap Launch Product with High Market Risk PV 000 000 Launch Product with Low Market Risk PVa 000 000 MarketTesting PV 000 000 Pb 30 Cancel Project and Salvage Assets PVb 500 000 EXHIBIT In this situation the team can either launch the product immediately and face great deal of market risk or it can test the market and then decide whether to launch the product 378 Chapter 17 positive cash flow of million There is 30 percent chance that the team will decide to cancel the project reaping only million in salvage value Thus the net present value of the project is NPV PV Pa PVa 191 PVb 000 000 70 000 000 30 500 000 650 000 Based on these estimates because the net present value exceeds that of just launching the product without testing the team would be better off spending the million to test the market There are of course many factors that influence decision about whether to launch product with high uncertainty or to perform further investigation Economic modeling can be used as one perspective for informing this kind of decision CHAPTER EIGHTEEN Managing Projects Courtesy of Eastman Kodak Company EXHIBIT The
