Chapter The economic success of most firms depends on their ability to identify the needs of customers and to quickly create products that meet these needs and can be produced at low cost Achieving these goals is not solely marketing problem nor is it solely design problem or manufacturing problem it is product development problem involving all of these functions This book provides collection of methods intended to enhance the abilities of cross functional teams to work together to develop products product is something sold by an enterprise to its customers Product development is the set of activities beginning with the perception of market opportunity and ending in the production sale and delivery of product Although much of the material in this book is useful in the development of any product we explicitly focus on products that are engineered discrete and physical Exhibit displays several examples of products from this category Because we focus on engineered products the book applies better to the development of power tools and computer peripherals than to magazines or sweaters Our focus on discrete goods makes the book less applicable to the development of products such as gasoline nylon and paper Because of the focus on physical products we do not emphasize the specific issues involved in developing services or software Even with these restrictions the methods presented apply well to broad range of products including for example consumer electronics sports equipment scientific instruments machine tools and medical devices The goal of this book is to present in clear and detailed way set of product development methods aimed at bringing together the marketing design and manufacturing functions of the enterprise In this introductory chapter we describe some aspects of the industrial practice of product development and provide roadmap of the book Characteristics of Successful Product Development From the perspective of the investors in for profit enterprise successful product development results in products that can be produced and sold profitably yet profitability is often difficult to assess quickly and directly Five more specific dimensions all of which ultimately relate to profit are commonly used to assess the performance of product development effort Product quality How good is the product resulting from the development effort Does it satisfy customer needs Is it robust and reliable Product quality is ultimately reflected in market share and the price that customers are willing to pay Product cost What is the manufacturing cost of the product This cost includes spending on capital equipment and tooling as well as the incremental cost of producing each unit of the product Product cost determines how much profit accrues to the firm for particular sales volume and particular sales price Development time How quickly did the team complete the product development effort Development time determines how responsive the firm can be to competitive forces and to technological developments as well as how quickly the firm receives the economic returns from the team efforts Development cost How much did the firm have to spend to develop the product Development cost is usually significant fraction of the investment required to achieve the profits Introduction Development capability Are the team and the firm better able to develop future products as result of their experience with product development project Development capability is an asset the firm can use to develop products more effectively and economically in the future High performance along these five dimensions should ultimately lead to economic success however other performance criteria are also important These criteria arise from interests of other stakeholders in the enterprise including the members of the development team other employees and the community in which the product is manufactured Members of the development team may be interested in creating an inherently exciting product Members of the community in which the product is manufactured may be concerned about the degree to which the product creates jobs Both production workers and users of the product hold the development team accountable to high safety standards whether or not these standards can be justified on the strict basis of profitability Other individuals who may have no direct connection to the firm or the product may demand that the product make ecologically sound use of resources and create minimal dangerous waste products Who Designs and Develops Products Product development is an interdisciplinary activity requiring contributions from nearly all the functions of firm however three functions are almost always central to product development project Marketing The marketing function mediates the interactions between the firm and its customers Marketing often facilitates the identification of product opportunities the definition of market segments and the identification of customer needs Marketing also typically arranges for communication between the firm and its customers sets target prices and oversees the launch and promotion of the product Design The design function plays the lead role in defining the physical form of the product to best meet customer needs In this context the design function includes engineering design mechanical electrical software etc and industrial design aesthetics ergonomics user interfaces Manufacturing The manufacturing function is primarily responsible for designing operating and or coordinating the production system in order to produce the product Broadly defined the manufacturing function also often includes purchasing distribution and installation This collection of activities is sometimes called the supply chain Different individuals within these functions often have specific disciplinary training in areas such as market research mechanical engineering electrical engineering materials science or manufacturing operations Several other functions including finance and sales are frequently involved on part time basis in the development of new product Beyond these broad functional categories the specific composition of development team depends on the particular characteristics of the product Few products are developed by single individual The collection of individuals developing product forms the project team This team usually has single team leader who could be drawn from any of the functions of the firm The team can be thought of as4 Chapter Marketing Professional Purchasing Specialist TEAM LEADER Mechanical Core Designer Team Extended Team Including Suppliers Electronics Designer Industrial Designer EXHIBIT The composition of product development team for an electromechanical product of modest complexity consisting of core team and an extended team In order to work together effectively the core team usually remains small enough to meet in conference room while the extended team may consist of dozens hundreds or even thousands of other members Even though the term team is inappropriate for group of thousands the word is often used in this context to emphasize that the group must work toward common goal In most cases team within the firm will be supported by individuals or teams at partner companies suppliers and consulting firms Sometimes as is the case for the development of new airplane the number of external team members may be even greater than that of the team within the company whose name will appear on the final product The composition of team for the development of an electromechanical product of modest complexity is shown in Exhibit Throughout this book we assume that the team is situated within firm In fact for profit manufacturing company is the most common institutional setting for product development but other settings are possible Product development teams sometimes work within consulting firms

available information and company sources Duration and Cost of Product Development Most people without experience in product development are astounded by how much time and money are required to develop new product The reality is that very few products can be developed in less than year many require to years and some take as long as 10 years Exhibit shows five engineered discrete products Exhibit is table showing the approximate scale of the associated product development efforts along with some distinguishing characteristics of the products The cost of product development is roughly proportional to the number of people on the project team and to the duration of the project In addition to expenses for development effort firm will almost always have to make some investment in the tooling and equipment required for production This expense is often as large as the rest of the product development budget however it is sometimes useful to think of these expenditures as part of the fixed costs of production For reference purposes this production investment is listed in Exhibit along with the development expenditures Chapter The Challenges of Product Development Developing great products is hard Few companies are highly successful more than half the time These odds present significant challenge for product development team Some of the characteristics that make product development challenging are Trade offs An airplane can be made lighter but this action will probably increase manufacturing cost One of the most difficult aspects of product development is recognizing understanding and managing such trade offs in way that maximizes the success of the product Dynamics Technologies improve customer preferences evolve competitors introduce new products and the macroeconomic environment shifts Decision making in an environment of constant change is formidable task Details The choice between using screws or snap fits on the enclosure of computer can have economic implications of millions of dollars Developing product of even modest complexity may require thousands of such decisions Time pressure Any one of these difficulties would be easily manageable by itself given plenty of time but product development decisions must usually be made quickly and without complete information Economics Developing producing and marketing new product requires large investment To earn reasonable return on this investment the resulting product must be both appealing to customers and relatively inexpensive to produce For many people product development is interesting precisely because it is challeng ing For others several intrinsic attributes also contribute to its appeal Creation The product development process begins with an idea and ends with the production of physical artifact When viewed both in its entirety and at the level of individual activities the product development process is intensely creative Satisfaction of societal and individual needs All products are aimed at satisfying needs of some kind Individuals interested in developing new products can almost always find institutional settings in which they can develop products satisfying what they consider to be important needs Team diversity Successful development requires many different skills and talents As result development teams involve people with wide range of different training experience perspectives and personalities Team spirit Product development teams are often highly motivated cooperative groups The team members may be colocated so they can focus their collective energy on creating the product This situation can result in lasting camaraderie among team members Approach of This Book We focus on product development activities that benefit from the participation of all the core functions of the firm For our purposes we define the core functions as marketing design and manufacturing We expect that team members have competence in one orIntroduction more specific disciplines such as mechanical engineering electrical engineering industrial design market research or manufacturing operations For this reason we do not discuss for example how to perform stress analysis or to create conjoint survey These are disciplinary skills we expect someone on the development team to possess The integrative methods in this book are intended to facilitate problem solving and decision making among people with different disciplinary perspectives Structured Methods The book consists of methods for completing development activities The methods are structured which means we generally provide step by step approach and often provide templates for the key information systems used by the team We believe structured methods are valuable for three reasons First they make the decision process explicit allowing everyone on the team to understand the decision rationale and reducing the possibility of moving forward with unsupported decisions Second by acting as checklists of the key steps in development activity they ensure that important issues are not forgotten Third structured methods are largely self documenting in the process of executing the method the team creates record of the decision making process for filture reference and for educating newcomers Although the methods are structured they are not intended to be applied blindly The methods are starting point for continuous improvement Teams should adapt and modify the approaches to meet their own needs and to reflect the unique character of their institutional environment Industrial Examples Each remaining chapter is built around an example drawn from industrial practice The major examples include the following wireless security system laser based cat toy digital copier cordless screwdriver mountain bike suspension fork power nailer dose metering syringe an electric scooter computer printer mobile telephone office seating products an automobile engine mobile robot seat belt system coffee cup insulator digital photo printer and microfilm cartridge In most cases we use as examples the simplest products we have access to that illustrate the important aspects of the methods When screwdriver illustrates an idea as well as jet engine we use the screwdriver However every method in this book has been used successfully in industrial practice by hundreds of people on both large and small projects Although built around examples the chapters are not intended to be historically accurate case studies We use the examples as way to illustrate development methods and in doing so we recast some historical details in way that improves the presentation of the material We also disguise much of the quantitative information in the examples especially financial data Organizational Realities We deliberately chose to present the methods with the assumption that the development team operates in an organizational environment conducive to success In reality some organizations exhibit characteristics that lead to dysfunctional product development teams These characteristics include Lack of empowerment of the team General managers or functional managers may engage in continual intervention in the details of development project without full understanding of the basis for the team decisions Chapter Functional allegiances transcending project goals Representatives of marketing design or manufacturing may influence decisions in order to increase the political standing of themselves or their functions without regard for the overall success of the product Inadequate resources team may be unable to complete development tasks effectively because of lack of staff mismatch of skills or lack of money equipment or tools Lack of cross functional representation on the project team Key development decisions may be made without involvement of marketing design manufacturing or other critical functions While most organizations exhibit one or more of these characteristics to some degree the significant presence of these problems can be so stifling that sound development methods are rendered ineffective While recognizing the importance of basic organizational issues we assume for clarity of explanation that the development team operates in an environment in which the most restrictive organizational barriers have been removed.
